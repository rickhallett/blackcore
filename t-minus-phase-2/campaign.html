            This document outlines a series of profound procedural, legal, and

            consultation. It serves as a formal complaint and a pre-action
            letter demanding immediate corrective action from Swanage Town
            Council (STC), its agent the Dorset Coast Forum (DCF), and their
            technology provider, Granicus Inc.

          <p class="content-text">
            The central issue is the mid-survey implementation of a

            Swanage Traffic Concern Group (NSTCG). We are in receipt of written

          <p class="content-text">
            The Swanage Shore Road project is a matter of significant public
            interest. To engage the community, Swanage Town Council, through its
            agent the Dorset Coast Forum, launched a public consultation survey
            hosted on the "Engagement HQ" platform, provided by Granicus Inc.
            The stated purpose was to gather public opinion to inform future
            policy.

              lawful, fair, and accountable consultation process on behalf of
              its constituents.

          <p class="content-text">
            The NSTCG is an informal, self-funded body of local residents and
            businesses. Our objective is to ensure that community engagement on
            the Shore Road project is fair, inclusive, and democratically
            legitimate. We undertook a grassroots campaign to encourage our
            neighbours to participate in the survey, an action wholly in keeping
            with the stated goals of the consultation. It was the success of
            this campaign that precipitated the events detailed below.

            3.1 Legitimate Public Engagement Campaign
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            The NSTCG initiated an on-the-ground public canvassing effort,
            resulting in a documented and foreseeable increase in survey
            participation from a diverse range of Swanage residents.

            3.2 The Unilateral Procedural Change
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            Following this traffic increase, a high-friction,
            visual/puzzle-based CAPTCHA was implemented on the survey submission
            page. This was done without public notice or explanation,
            fundamentally altering the conditions of participation mid-process.
            This action created an immediate and significant barrier for many
            users, particularly older residents and those with visual or
            cognitive impairments.
          </p>

          <h3 id="section3-3" class="subsection-header">
            3.3 Confirmation of Responsibility
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            In correspondence with the NSTCG, Toni Powell of the Dorset Coast
            Forum confirmed that this was a "human intervention" and stated it
            was made following a direct "<strong
              >recommendation from Granicus Engagement HQ</strong
            >." This places the catalyst for the procedural failure squarely
            with the expert advice of the technology provider, Granicus, and the
            decision to implement it with the agent, DCF.

            3.4 Formal Challenge and Evasion
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            The NSTCG issued a formal query to Granicus on July 8, 2025,
            detailing the technical, legal, and ethical failures. To date, no
            substantive response has been received. This silence is taken as an
            admission of the facts as stated.

            4.1 Swanage Town Council: A Failure of Governance & Oversight
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            As the client, STC failed to ensure its agent and supplier were
            conducting a lawful process. It failed in its Public Sector Equality
            Duty to have "due regard" for accessibility, failed in its fiduciary
            duty by allowing public funds to be spent on a process that is now
            worthless, and failed to maintain the trust of its community.
          </p>

            4.2 Dorset Coast Forum: A Failure of Procedural Integrity & Due
            Diligence
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            As the agent, DCF failed to protect the integrity of the
            consultation. It uncritically accepted negligent advice from its
            supplier and implemented a change that it knew or should have known
            would disenfranchise a significant part of the community it was
            tasked with engaging. This is a fundamental failure of project
            management and due diligence.

            4.3 Granicus Inc.: A Failure of Technical, Ethical, and Professional
            Duty
          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            As the provider, Granicus is the origin of the failure. Its
            technical systems failed by misinterpreting citizen engagement as a
            bot attack. Its advisory function failed by recommending a
            discriminatory and legally non-compliant solution. Its professional
            duty failed by providing advice that was directly contrary to its
            own corporate mission of fostering engagement. This represents a
            multi-layered failure of competence and corporate ethics.

          </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
            The implementation of the CAPTCHA is a <em>prima facie</em> case of
            <strong>Indirect Discrimination</strong> (Section 19), as it places
            older users and those with disabilities at a distinct disadvantage.
            Furthermore, the failure to provide any accessible alternative
            represents a clear breach of the
            <strong>Public Sector Equality Duty</strong> (Section 149) and the
            <strong>Duty to Make Reasonable Adjustments</strong> (Section 20).

          <p class="content-text">
            The core principles of data processing were violated. Processing
            data from a systematically biased sample fails the test of
            <strong>Fairness</strong>. Altering the submission process without

          <p class="content-text">
            The process fails the established legal tests for a lawful
            consultation. By changing the rules mid-stream, it was not conducted
            at a <strong>formative stage</strong>. By not providing reasons for
            the change, it prevented <strong>intelligent consideration</strong>.
            By functionally reducing time for disabled users, it failed to

            standard of "reasonable care and skill" expected of an expert
            GovTech provider. This negligence has foreseeably caused harm and
            exposed its client to legal jeopardy, likely constituting a breach

              A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell
              Computers and Humans Apart) is a security mechanism designed for a
              single, specific purpose: to mitigate large-scale, automated
              attacks perpetrated by non-human actors (bots). Its legitimate
              application is warranted only when there is clear technical
              evidence of malicious, automated activity, such as botnet-driven
              spam or Denial-of-Service attacks.

              traffic" was a direct and foreseeable result of a successful,
              on-the-ground public canvassing campaign. This activity generates

              To interpret a predictable increase in community engagement as a

              critical failure of technical analysis and professional judgment.
              It treats citizen engagement as a threat to be mitigated, not an
              objective to be encouraged.

              Appendix D: Failure to Meet Lawful Standards of Public
              Consultation (The Gunning Principles)
            </h2>

            <p class="content-text">
              Public consultation in the UK is governed by common law principles
              for fairness, established in
              <em>R v Brent London Borough Council, ex parte Gunning</em>
              (1985). The mid-survey implementation of CAPTCHA caused a clear
              failure to meet at least three of the four principles.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-header">
              1. Consultation must be at a formative stage.
            </h3>
            <p class="content-text">
              While the survey began at a formative stage, the unilateral
              alteration of its access mechanism was not. A fundamental change
              was introduced after public opinion had already begun to be
              recorded, invalidating this principle by retrospectively changing
              the conditions of engagement.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-header">
              2. The proposer must give sufficient reasons for any proposal to
              permit of intelligent consideration and response.
            </h3>
            <p class="content-text">
              This principle extends to the process itself. The public was given
              no reason or warning for the sudden introduction of a
              participation barrier. This lack of transparency precludes
              "intelligent consideration" of the process and fosters distrust.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-header">
              3. Adequate time must be given for consideration and response.
            </h3>
            <p class="content-text">
              This is the most egregious failure. The CAPTCHA functionally
              <strong>removes or reduces time</strong> for specific
              demographics. Each failed attempt, each moment of frustration
              leading to abandonment, is time being stolen from the user. For an
              older resident, a 5-minute struggle can be the difference between
              completing the survey and giving up entirely.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-header">
              4. The product of consultation must be conscientiously taken into
              account.
            </h3>
            <p class="content-text">
              The "product" of this consultation is now a contaminated dataset.
              By implementing a change that systematically biases the results,
              the consulting body has created a product that <em>cannot</em> be
              conscientiously taken into account, as it is no longer a valid
              representation of public opinion.
            </p>

            <p class="content-text">
              <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The actions taken fail the
              established legal tests for a fair and lawful public consultation.
              The process has been rendered procedurally improper and is
              therefore vulnerable to legal challenge.

              The Swanage community is demonstrably and significantly older than

              experience higher rates of visual, motor, and cognitive
              impairments. The decision to implement a CAPTCHA was therefore a
              decision to place a substantial and discriminatory barrier before
              more than a third of the target population. A discriminatory
              outcome was not just possible, but statistically probable and
              should have been foreseen by the public bodies and their expert
              provider.

            <p class="content-text">
              For a survey's results to be statistically valid, the data must be
              collected under consistent conditions. A representative sample
              allows one to make inferences about the entire population. If the
              method of collection changes part-way through, the sample's
              integrity is destroyed.

            <p class="content-text">
              The implementation of the CAPTCHA mid-survey created a clear
              contamination event. It split the survey's respondents into two
              incompatible cohorts who were subjected to different conditions:

              <li>
                <strong>Cohort B (Post-CAPTCHA):</strong> A closed,
                high-friction, discriminatory submission process.

              3.0 Systematic Bias vs. Random Noise
            </h3>
            <p class="content-text">
              The procedural change did not merely add random "noise" to the
              data. It introduced a powerful <strong>systematic bias</strong>.
              The CAPTCHA acts as a filter, specifically removing or reducing
              responses from a particular demographic: those who are older, less
              tech-savvy, or have visual, motor, or cognitive impairments. As
              this demographic may hold different views on traffic and
              infrastructure from other groups, systematically excluding them
              fundamentally skews the final results.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-header">4.0 Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
              The dataset is irrevocably contaminated. It is not possible to
              merge the two cohorts, nor is it possible to know "what might have
              been" had the conditions remained consistent. Any attempt to
              analyse this data as a single, representative sample of the
              Swanage community would be statistically illiterate and
              professionally negligent. The data is biased, untrustworthy, and
              unfit for the purpose of informing public policy.

            <p class="content-text">
              From a peer engineering perspective, this sequence of events is
              deeply concerning. It points to a reactive, rather than proactive,
              operational posture and suggests a potential cultural gap where
              user experience and data integrity are subordinated to crude
              security metrics. It is difficult to reconcile these actions with
              the operational maturity expected of a FedRAMP-authorized GovTech
              leader.

                    You have documented a clear "chain of failure" from the
                    client (STC) to the agent (DCF) to the supplier (Granicus).
                    This is a massive strategic advantage. They cannot easily
                    scapegoat a single party. If STC blames Granicus, they are
                    admitting their own failure of oversight and contract
                    management. If Granicus stays silent, they leave their
                    client legally exposed.

                    <strong>How to leverage it:</strong> Never allow them to
                    isolate one party. Address all communications and demands to
                    all three. Constantly highlight their shared responsibility.
                    Ask questions in public forums like: "Who is ultimately
                    accountable to the taxpayer for this failure? The council
                    who paid for it, the agent who managed it, or the supplier
                    who recommended it?" This forces them to either turn on each
                    other or accept collective responsibility.

                    You have identified Granicus's private equity owner. This is
                    a critical pressure point you may be underestimating. A
                    local council is politically accountable, but a global
                    corporation is financially and reputationally accountable to
                    its investors.

                    <strong>How to leverage it:</strong> ESG (Environmental,
                    Social, and Governance) principles are no longer optional
                    for major investment firms like Vista Equity Partners. A
                    formal, evidence-backed complaint to them arguing that their
                    portfolio company is engaged in socially damaging,
                    anti-democratic, and legally risky practices is a corporate
                    nightmare. This is the lever that can produce a very fast
                    response when a council might otherwise stall for months.

              You must anticipate the defence strategy of your opponents. They
              will not admit to malice. Here are the most likely attacks and how

                  <li>
                    <strong>The Weakness:</strong> Their strongest defence is to
                    admit to a mistake, but not to a deliberate act of
                    suppression. They will say, "We sincerely apologise. Our
                    supplier mistakenly identified a security threat and we
                    overreacted. There was no intent to disenfranchise anyone."
                    This is designed to deflate the public anger and frame your
                    aggressive campaign as an overreaction.

                  <li>
                    <strong>How to Mitigate:</strong> Your entire case must be
                    built on the principle that
                    <strong
                      >intent is irrelevant; the outcome was discriminatory and
                      the process was unlawful.</strong
                    >
                    For the Equality Act and the PSED, the <em>effect</em> of a
                    policy is what matters, not the intention behind it. For the
                    Gunning Principles, it's about whether the
                    <em>process</em> was fair. Proving a conspiracy is hard and
                    unnecessary. Focus relentlessly on the objective, documented
                    failures. Use the phrase:
                    <em
                      >"Whether this was a result of incompetence or intent, the
                      result is the same: a discriminatory and unlawful process

                    <strong>The Weakness:</strong> They will attempt to isolate
                    you and paint the NSTCG as "a small group of activists" or a

                    most powerful tool here. Gather more than you think you
                    need. Launching a simple public petition demanding the
                    survey be re-run is another excellent way to gather hundreds
                    of names, proving you have broad support. Frame every action
                    as being taken "on behalf of our neighbours who were unable

                    or that there was other information (e.g., a "security
                    report" from Granicus) that justified the action. Granicus
                    may produce a heavily redacted, after-the-fact "analysis"

                    <strong>How to Mitigate:</strong> This is why your technical
                    appendix and evidence log are so important. You must be
                    ready to publicly challenge the methodology of any report
                    they produce. Demand, via FOIA, the specific, non-anecdotal
                    data they relied on (as per your Appendix J questions). When
                    they fail to provide it, it strengthens your case that the
                    report is a post-facto justification. The "context" of the
                    email is the entire timeline of events—your successful

                It highlights that the system has failed so profoundly that

              The risk of it backfiring (e.g., being portrayed as "wealthy

              substantial, painful amount for most people, not a trivial sum. It
              demonstrates commitment, not wealth. This detail is a strategic

              You are absolutely right to think this way. Your insight is
              spot-on and gets to the core of modern campaigning:
              <strong
                >the petition is not the campaign, it is the
                <em>destination</em> of the campaign.</strong

            </p>

            <p class="content-text">
              You are correct that just posting a link to a petition is
              "old-school" and will fail to engage most people, especially
              younger demographics. The key is not the petition itself, but the
              <strong>shareable, viral-potential content</strong> that drives
              people to it.

                <li>
                  <strong>Pro:</strong> It's a global brand with massive name
                  recognition. It's built for shareability and has a higher
                  chance of "going viral" in a general sense, potentially
                  attracting international media and attention. The user
                  interface is very slick and easy to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Con:</strong> It's often seen as a platform for
                  "slacktivism." A savvy council or company could try to dismiss
                  it by saying, "This just has thousands of unverified
                  signatures from all over the world; it doesn't reflect local

                  <strong>Pro:</strong> It is highly respected and specifically
                  focused on <strong>UK political campaigning.</strong> This
                  gives it immense credibility when targeting a UK council. If
                  your petition gains traction, the 38 Degrees team itself may
                  lend its significant campaigning and media expertise to your
                  cause. It signals that you are serious about UK political
                  change, not just making noise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Con:</strong> It has a smaller, UK-focused user base,
                  so the "viral loop" is less explosive than on Change.org.

                <strong>38 Degrees is the superior choice.</strong> The
                credibility it lends is more valuable than the broader but

                    Put a <strong>QR code</strong> linking directly to the 38
                    Degrees petition on every single physical leaflet and poster
                    you create. This is non-negotiable. It seamlessly connects
                    your real-world campaign to your digital one. Someone sees a
                    poster in a shop window, scans it, and signs while they wait
                    for their coffee.

              By focusing your energy on creating these powerful, emotional, and
              shareable stories, the petition becomes the logical end point for
              the outrage you generate. You are right—no one cares about the
              petition itself. They care about injustice, fairness, and the
              story of David vs. Goliath. That's what you sell them.
