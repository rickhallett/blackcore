Purpose: A simple demonstration script for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the deduplication feature.
Utility: It uses a hardcoded sample transcript and a basic configuration to show the deduplication logic in action, printing the expected outcomes to the console. It's useful for quick, isolated tests of the basic matching rules.
