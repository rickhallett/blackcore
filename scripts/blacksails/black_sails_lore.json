    "synopsis": "The episode begins with a pirate ship, theWalrus, in hot pursuit of a merchantman commanded byCaptain Parrish. Despite the protestations of his first mate, Parrish decides to fight the oncoming ship. Below decks, a cook and a member of the deck crew,John Silver, bar themselves in a room in hopes of avoiding the fight. During the attack, an item falls out of the hands of the cook who immediately scrambles for it as if his life depended on it. Silver recognizes that it must be of some value and threatens to take it from the cook, who retaliates against Silver with a cutlass. The merchantman is soon overwhelmed and boarded by the pirates, led byCaptain J. Flint. During the mêlée, Parrish shoots one of the pirates, and is attacked by an aggressive looking pirate namedSingleton, but is saved by a masked pirate who soon reveals himself to be Flint, who tells them both the fight is over.\n\nWhen the fighting is over, Silver is discovered standing over the body of the cook by Flint'sQuartermaster,Gates. Silver tells them the man killed himself, then asks to join the crew of theWalrus, claiming to be an excellent cook. Above decks,Singletonis giving a speech to the captured seamen, claiming that his fight was never with them, but with their \"tyrant captain\", who is tied to the main mast awaiting torture. Back below decks, Flint reveals to Gates why they attacked that specific merchantman: He is looking for the shippingscheduleof a Spanish galleon,Urca de Lima, which was apparently contained within Parrish's logbooks. However, he reports to Gates that the page is missing, having been torn from the book. When Flint interrogates Parrish about the missing page, Parrish feigns ignorance. As Parrish is about to be tortured, a British Man-of-war appears on the horizon and theWalrusis forced to flee.\n\nWith theWalrussafely away from the British ship, John Silver is accepted into the crew as the new cook. Alone for the first time, he opens up the item that the cook had fought him for and it is revealed to be the page torn from the logbook that Flint is searching for. In the Captain's quarters, Gates informs Flint that he believes Singleton is very close to having enough votes to depose Flint from his captaincy. Gates states that the crew is desperate for larger prizes and feels that Flint is no longer effective. With the schedule seemingly lost, Flint tells Gates that he plans to get a copy of the schedule fromRichard Guthrie, the chief black market merchant inNassau.\n\nArriving at Nassau, Silver is confronted by two pirates who tell him that all new recruits must meetBlackbeard. Fearing that he is about to meetthe infamous pirate captain, Silver is relieved to discover that Blackbeard is actually the name of a uniquely endowed prostitute who, along with other prostitutes, begin an orgy with Silver. One of these prostitutes,Max, notices that during the affair, Silver's attention is focused on a particular item that is lying on the floor with his clothes despite being surrounded by beautiful women. When Silver wakes up, Max is standing in possession of the item. She has divined that the item must be of great importance for him to have paid such attention to it and proposes to Silver that she can help him sell whatever it is, as long as she can keep half the profit. When she asks Silver what it is, he responds that he honestly does not know. Believing that the document came from a logbook that is in Captain Flint's cabin, Silver and Max row out to theWalrus, which is anchored and sitting empty while the crew is ashore. Once in the Captain's cabin, Silver discovers the logbook hidden in a drawer and only then figures out what he has in his possession. Unbeknownst to Silver, a small white feather from the Inn mattress falls to the floor when he opens the drawer.\n\nAlso in Nassau, Gates enters a tavern run byEleanor Guthrie, the daughter of Richard Guthrie. Eleanor is a hardnosed businesswoman who finances many pirate crews, including Flint's. Gates meets with Eleanor and her adviserMr. Scottand explains that there is an agitator on board, Singleton, who is about to unseat Flint as captain. Gates asks Eleanor for money to pay off bribes that he must give out to keep the votes from swinging in Singleton's favor. Gates claims that she should give him the money as a \"sort of investment\" because if Singleton were made captain, he would surely be a disaster, therefore Eleanor's profits would diminish. Against the advice of Mr. Scott, Eleanor agrees to pay the money.\n\nLeaving the tavern, Gates goes and talks toMosiah, who is the de facto leader of the African members of theWalruscrew. If Gates can get Mosiah and the other Africans' support, Singleton will be one vote short. Mosiah agrees to put his support behind Flint. As Gates is leaving his conversation with Mosiah, he is spotted byRackham, the quartermaster ofCaptain Charles Vane'sship theRanger. Quickly understanding what he has just seen, Rackham goes and tells Singleton. Singleton sets up a meeting on the beach with Mosiah, who brings another African member of theWalrus'screw namedLevias protection. When questioned by Singleton, Mosiah admits that he is backing Flint in the upcoming election. When Mosiah and Levi turn to leave, they are confronted by Rackham,Anne Bonny, and their Charles Vane. Levi attempts to attack, but is quickly killed by Anne. They then kill Mosiah.\n\nBack at the tavern, an African member of theWalrus'screw,Joshua, tells Gates that he has found Mosiah on the beach. Joshua, Gates, Mr. Scott, and Eleanor rush down to the beach where they see the corpse of Mosiah. Joshua explains that before Mosiah died he uttered one word: \"Vane.\" Eleanor immediately runs back up to her tavern where she finds Vane and punches him in the face. He responds in turn by punching her in the face. Vane later enters Eleanor's room and asks why she punched him. She explains that he has screwed her over with his attempt to put Flint out of business by backing Singleton's efforts. When she threatens to not sell any more of his captured booty, Vane scoffs and states that it is her father, not her, who commands the black market. He also states that even though he once loved her, if she ever strikes him again in front of his men, he will not be so forgiving.\n\nEleanor goes to her room, where she meets Max, who becomes upset when she sees Eleanor bruised from her encounter with Vane. She comforts Eleanor, telling her that when things become hard, that she can come to Max, who will be her shelter from the storm. She then kisses Eleanor, and they spend the night together.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain Flint is making good on his attempt to get Richard Guthrie to duplicate the schedule. With theWalrus'sBoatswain,Billy Bones, accompanying him, Flint arrives at Guthrie's mansion and requests an audience with Guthrie. At the meeting with Guthrie, Flint tells him about his desire to capture theUrca de Limaand about his pursuit of the missing schedule. When he asks Guthrie to introduce him to his Spanish contacts so he can recreate the schedule, Guthrie refuses, stating that the risks are far too high to get involved. Flint attempts to physically coerce Guthrie into giving up the name of his Spanish contact in Havana, but before he succeeds he is interrupted by several members of the British Royal Navy, led byCaptain Humeof theScarborough. When confronted by Hume, Guthrie pretends that Flint and Bones are justsugarmerchants. Hume, who suspects that Guthrie is running a black market alongside pirates, sees through this ruse and orders that they all be arrested.  Flint and Bones attack Hume and his crew, disabling them. However, during themêléeGuthrie is shot in the shoulder and has fallen unconscious. Flint decides it is best to take Guthrie with them back to theWalrus. As they approach theWalrus, Bones expresses some apprehension toward Flint's leadership. Flint tells Bones that they are going to need to rally behind him because he can get them through the war that is coming, not someone like Singleton. When Bones responds that they are not at war with anyone, Flint states that they are about to be at war with all of civilization. Before they reach the ship, Flint stripes Guthrie of his clothes andwig, hoping to disguise Guthrie's identity since no member of the crew has ever actually seen Guthrie in person.\n\nOnce aboard the ship, Gates tells Flint that it is time for the vote. Before the vote, Flint retires to his cabin for a moment, where he discovers the white feather.  Realizing that it came from off the ship and there it is likely that a member of his own crew has the schedule, Flint devises a scheme. Back up on the boat deck, Flint accuses Singleton of having undermined their effort to capture the treasure ship by stealing the schedule from the logbook. Gates explains that a conviction of theft carries with it the death sentence, as well as does a false accusation of thievery. Gates tells Singleton that he can either have a trial, which Singleton promptly rejects believing it would be rigged, or he can have a duel against his accuser. Singleton gladly accepts a duel against Flint. During the fight, Singleton initially has the upper hand, but Flint recovers and the fight ends when Flint beats Singleton to death with a cannonball.\n\nStill hovering over the defeated Singleton, Flint pulls a piece of paper from the clothes of Singleton and hands it to Bones. Bones opens the paper and sees that it is blank. Bones's loyalty is effectively put to the test by Flint handing him the paper. Bones can either expose Flint for being a liar or can claim that it is the missing schedule, exonerating Flint. Bones chooses to stick by Flint and tells the crew that it is indeed the missing schedule. Flint then reveals his mission to capture theUrca de Lima. He claims that the ship is of such value that it will make them \"princes of the New World.\" The crew, their morale boosted, begins chanting his name in support.\n\nBack at the tavern, the prostituteIdelleapproaches Max and tells her that the man she is looking for is downstairs. Max goes downstairs and climbs into the lap of Rackham, stating \"I think I might have something you might want to buy.\"\n\n",

    "synopsis": "After spending the night withMax,Eleanorand Max wake up in bed together. Eleanor looks out at the morning hustle and bustle ofNassauand explains to Max how primitive the town used to be when her father still ran things in the town. She states that he hasn't set foot in the town in five years.Mr. Scottapproaches and says that Eleanor is needed downstairs.\n\nBack on theWalrus,Dufresneis trying to calm the crew down, who are in quite an excitable state after witnessingSingleton's beat down and hearingFlint'splan to capture theUrca de Lima. Still holding the blank page that Flint handed him,Billy Bonesstands in shock wondering what he has just done by lying on Flint's behalf. In the captain's cabin, Flint explains to Bones andGatesthat he knows that the thief is someone on the ship because someone had been in his room looking at the logbook to try and figure out what they had. They come to the conclusion that the only person who might have known about the page and who wasn't searched after the battle was their new cook:John Silver.\n\nBack up on the boat deck, panicky Silver implores Dufresne to let him onto a longboat that has just left the ship heading toward shore. As this is happening, Bones and Gates arrive on deck and start moving toward Silver. Fearing that he is about to be apprehended, Silver jumps overboard, belly-flops into the water, and swims towards the longboat. As the boat approaches the shore, Silver looks back and realizes that Flint, Gates, and Bones are in their own boat chasing him. When he arrives on shore, Silver asks multiple men on the beach the directions to various locations. Thus, when Flint arrives on the beach and asks them where Silver went, they all point in different directions.\n\nSilver finally finds sanctuary in Max's room at the tavern where he interrupts her while she is with a client. Silver explains to her that Flint has found out about him and is looking for him, but that he still thinks they can complete the deal. When she states her fear that Flint will come looking for her, Silver responds by saying that he has plans for them to escape toPort Royalonce the deal is done.\n\nAt the Ranger's campsite,Rackhamhas theRanger'sclerk count out 5,000 pesos in pearls. When confronted byVane, Rackham tells Vane about the proposal that Max made to sell him the map. Vane is not convinced that the purchase would be a sound investment and thinks they are being duped. Rackham calls out Vane's lack of leads lately, claiming that leads have been few and far between since Vane and Eleanor had their falling out. Vane gives the pearls back to Rackham and walks away.\n\nBack at Eleanor's tavern, Mr. Scott tells Eleanor that a pirate crew from Carolina just arrived with a large haul. Before she goes to meet the new crew, Mr. Scott takes her aside and chastises her for running from the beach the previous night and striking Vane. He explains that she must never forget who these men are and that the only reason their knives aren't in either of their throats is because who her father is. Once outside, the new Captain in town,James Bridgeof theDemeteris rude and condescending to Eleanor as she informs him how business works in the port. When she states that her take is half of his profit, he scoffs and threatens to take his goods elsewhere. As he begins to leave, he encounters Vane who tells him that the last man who denied \"Miss Guthrie\" was never seen or heard from again but his goods were seen back in Nassau the very next day. Bridge remains haughty until Vane tells him who he is, whereupon Bridge graciously accepts Eleanor's terms. After he Bridge leaves, Vane tells Eleanor that they need to talk in private.\n\nIn Eleanor's office, Vane pleads with her for more leads to prize scores. Vane says he believes that the lack of information Eleanor is giving him about potential prizes is personal and that he'd like to put an end to it. Eleanor states that she finds his suggestion preposterous and that she only stopped giving him leads because she doesn't like the way he runs his ship. She tells him that his men are unruly, undisciplined, and what they cause in damages is twice as much as the profits they bring in. Flint enters the tavern with his men, revealing to a surprised Vane that he was not deposed as captain. Asking to speak to Eleanor, Flint explains that her fatherRichardis a wanted man and is currently a fugitive on theWalrus. Eleanor is dismayed at the thought of her father being a wanted man because he has been bribing the Lords Proprietor for years. Mr. Scott expresses concern over Flint's nonchalant attitude toward the new development with Mr. Guthrie, explaining to Flint that without Guthrie's protection they are finished in Nassau. Flint responds by telling them the story about theUrca de Limaand theschedulethey are chasing. He also tells them about his dream of creating a \"nation of thieves\".\n\nOn the balcony of the tavern, Gates sits observing anappraiserarguing with alocal captainon the street below. Bones approaches and admonishes Gates for just sitting around when they are supposed to be looking for the cook. Gates explains that they must follow the appraiser because if he were the cook and was trying to sell the map he would need two things, a boat and a method of payment. Gold would be too heavy a form of payment but jewels would not be therefore there would need to be an appraiser involved in any potential transaction between the cook and a buyer paying in jewels. They follow the appraiser into a brothel where he enters a room with Anne Bonny standing guard outside.\n\nInside the room, the appraiser looks at the jewels as Rackham and Max patiently wait the conclusion of the appraisal. Through a peephole in an adjoining room, Silver looks in on the transaction. Once the appraiser leaves, Max and Rackham agree that the exchange will take place at a site call The Wrecks at sundown. Just then, Vane busts in the room and tells Rackham that Max doesn't have the page, but Flint does. Vane had apparently heard the story from crew members of the Walrus about Flint taking the schedule from the body of Singleton. Vane then shoves Max up against a wall and begins to choke her, feeling that she is trying to play him for a fool. Rackham explains to Vane that Flint is just bluffing about finding the page as a means to end the mutiny that was brewing.\n\nAs Max continues being choked by Vane, Rackham sees that she is apparently waving off someone in the direction of the wall. Rackham looks over at the wall and spots the peephole. Rackham jabs a dagger into the peephole barely missing Silver who immediately runs away, leaving Rackham with only an empty room to investigate. Now suspecting some truth to what Max is telling him, Vane tells her that he will go along with the plan and meet for the exchange atthe Wrecks.\n\nLater, Eleanor confronts Max as she is convalescing and demands to that Max hand over the schedule. Max tries to convince Eleanor to come with her away from Nassau and start a fresh life with the money she will have earned from selling the schedule. Before they can settle the argument, Flint, Bones, and Gates arrive and Eleanor is faced with a choice: run away with Max or side with Flint. She decides to go along with Flint and forces Max into telling her the plans about the exchange. Max is devastated by Eleanor's decision and falls to the floor weeping.\n\nLater that evening, Rackham and Vane arrive at the Wrecks looking for Silver. They are approached by a man acting as Silver's agent who asks that they hand over the pearls to him. Vane disapproves and begins screaming aloud, demanding that Silver show his face. When Silver offers no response, Vane pulls out a knife and stabs the man to death. A second old man approaches Vane from the shadows and tells him that Silver says that he can leave the pearls. Before any resolution comes of this, Billy Bones sneaks up behind Silver and fires a pistol at him. The bullet narrowly misses Silver and as he sprints away he finds himself now being chased by Bones, Flint, Vane, and Rackham. Avoiding this pursuers for some distance, Silver comes upon a group of dregs sitting by a campfire. Silver disguises himself as one of them and begins furiously studying the schedule. Once satisfied that he has it memorized, he quickly burns it. Elsewhere, Rackham, thinking he has found Silver, instead is presented with a severely disfigured man. This unnerves Rackham so badly that he loses his balance and falls into the sea below, losing the pearls in the water. Silver continues his\n\nescape but is jumped by Flint and Bones. As they demand that he hand over the schedule, Silver confesses that he burned it and memorized the contents as a method of self-preservation.\n\nBack in Nassau, Max uses the aid ofIdelleto escape the brothel. Obviously disturbed by that day's events, Eleanor asks Mr. Scott to stay with her that night. Later, Flint is seen riding on horseback throughout the island before entering a woman's home and collapsing on the floor from exhaustion.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens withCaptain Flintawaking in the home ofMiranda Barlow. As Miranda tends to the\n\nwounds he incurred during the duel with Singleton, he tells her that he has found theschedule. Not long after, Gates appears outside Miranda's house with awagoncontaining the woundedRichard Guthrie. Flint tells Miranda that he needs a favor from her.\n\nAt Eleanor's tavern,EleanorandBilly Bonesstand watch overJohn Silveras he transcribes to paper what he had memorized from the schedule before he burned it.Mr. Scottinterrupts and tells Eleanor that Max has left and has likely sailed away. Eleanor is incredulous that Max wouldn't accept her offer.\n\nIn the streets of Nassau,Rackhamis confronted by several crew members of theRanger. They say that he promised them a score and now there is not only not a score, but they are also out 5,000 pesos of their collective booty. Rackham responds by telling them that he is just as disappointed as they are and if they are so sure that his value to them is exhausted that they should elect another quartermaster.\n\nBack at Eleanor's tavern, Silver hands over the transcription of the schedule. Flint remarks that the transcription is incomplete because theUrcahas to stop in Florida to take on water but there is no mention of this on the schedule. Silver explains that in the interest of self-preservation, he intentionally left off some of the latter details of theUrca'scourse. When they threaten to bringJojiin to torture the remaining bits out of him, Silver states that he has an exceptionally low tolerance for pain and he would tell them anything to make it stop, so that wouldn't work. Silver proposes a mutually beneficial arrangement to Flint. He offers to remain with the crew and to forego payment for the schedule in exchange for a share of the prize.\n\nFlint appears to reluctantly accept Silver's proposition and asks Eleanor if she agrees to it, which she does. Flint states that this type of operation is going to require a consort i.e. another ship. Flint goes on to list to Eleanor a number of items that they will need for the expedition, including a dozen new 12 pounder cannons. He tells Eleanor that when they attack theUrcathey are going to need heavier artillery pieces if they are going to do anything more than make a scratch against her hull. Eleanor tells Flint that she will get them for him. Later, Mr. Scott asks Eleanor where she thinks she is going to find the guns for Flint. She tells him that a merchant captain namedBrysonis due back in port in a few days and that she will take the guns from him. Mr. Scott goes on further to explain that they probably shouldn't expect any more supply ships to show up in port now that word has surely got around that Richard Guthrie is being accused of black marketing. Eleanor retorts that that just means that her father will have to help her in Flint's expedition.\n\nOutside on the streets, Bones expresses his reluctance to Gates about Flint accepting Silver as a member of the crew, stating that there are still men on board that don't support Flint's captaincy and that Silver might slip up and tell them the truth that Singleton did not steal the schedule. Bones suggests that they canvass the crew and find out which crew members are still against Flint so that they may be put on different watches than Silver.\n\nBones takes Silver to whereRandallis sitting peeling potatoes. Bones tells Randall that he won a bet with Silver and now Silver has to help Randall peel potatoes for the rest of the day. Silver then tries to befriend Randall by making small talk. What he is really trying to do is cozy up to Randall so that Randall will tell him which crew members are still against Flint. Randall then apparently tells Silver thatMorleyandTurkremain against Flint. Silver then relays this information to Bones in the hopes that he can appear more trustworthy to the quartermaster.\n\nAt Miranda's house, Richard Guthrie awakes to see his daughter Eleanor there sitting on his bed. Eleanor tells Richard that he needs his help. If they are to remain in business they are going to need someone with ships and power. When he says nothing and looks away from her, Eleanor explains to him that he only has two choices: help her or flee to Boston where his father and brothers still live.\n\nAtop a fortress overlooking the harbor in Nassau, Gates visits with an old friend,Captain Benjamin Hornigold. While\n\nGates attempts some pleasantries; Hornigold cuts him off and says that he already knows why Gates is there: to ask that he and his ship act as Flint's consort in the expedition. Gates informs Hornigold that Flint doesn't want Hornigold but rather just wants his ship and his crew and that the captain of this ship will be himself. Hornigold agrees to the proposition.\n\nLater that day, as Gates sits looking at navigational charts, he is approached by an overly friendly Rackham. Gates is immediately skeptical and calls Rackham out for his obvious desperation, stating that he knows about Rackham and the lost pearls. Rackham then begins to plant a seed of doubt into Gates about Gates' looming captaincy. He questions whether Gates is too old for such a job; what if he oversleeps or hurts his bum knee. This seed of doubt apparently grows because Gates immediately goes to find Flint and proposes that they use Charles Vane and theRangercrew as their consort.\n\nInside a brothel, Rackham confronts Vane about acting as Flint's consort. When Vane expresses reluctance, Rackham explains to him that since Eleanor is backing the expedition, were Vane to participate and help it succeed, then that might get him back in Eleanor's good graces.\n\nLater, inside Eleanor's tavern, the meeting is set up between Vane and Flint. As soon as the meeting begins, Flint interjects that he wants to talk aboutMosiah. He demands that before they even begin to discuss anything, he wants to hear Vane apologize for Mosiah's murder. Gates immediately jumps in and takes Flint outside where he explains that Flint must behave himself or nothing will get accomplished. They eventually agree to terms with Vane joking about how surprising it is that he is the only one behaving himself.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Vane and Rackham are walking down the street when Vane directs Rackham to a small hut. Inside is a naked and battered Max. The crew of theRangerhad apparently been raping her throughout the day. Vane approaches her and begins to talk to her. He asks why, even though Eleanor was offering her protection, she left the\n\ntavern. Max answers by asking Vane how he felt when Eleanor threwhimaside. Vane leaves the hut and tells Rackham to take her out during the night and put her on a boat and to do it as quietly as possible. When Rackham asks what will happen if she comes back, Vane replies that she won't.\n\nBack at Miranda's house, she is greeted outside byPastor Lambrickwho is making his weekly visits. Lambrick shares with Miranda his upcoming Easter sermon. As she looks over it, Richard Guthrie sneaks around inside the house. He comes across a painting of Miranda and another man that is labelled \"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Hamilton.\" Outside, Lambrick lets Miranda know that she has neighbors that are beginning to gossip about the questionable visits she receives at her house from certain men. Miranda seems not to care about this gossip. Lambrick also mentions that there are certain people in his church who are claiming that a Royal Navy ship, theScarboroughhas docked nearby and that the King might wish to reestablish colonial rule over Nassau. He then flat out asks her \"is he keeping you here?\", likely referring to her relationship with Flint. Miranda does not answer but gets up and wishes Lambrick a good day.\n\nBack in Nassau, Eleanor enters Vane's tent and the two make love. At the same time, Rackham is attempting to escort Max to a boat when he is intercepted by Hamund and otherRangercrew members. He states that even though it was Vane who brought her here,theywill decide when they are through with her. As Eleanor is dressing inside Vane's tent, she hears a woman screaming outside. It is the sound of Max's screams as she is being raped by Hamund in the middle of the street. Eleanor grabs a tent beam and attacks Hamund, who quickly moves away from Max.\n\nEleanor quickly realizes that Vane was behind Max's brutal treatment. She makes a public declaration to theRanger'screw that she will not sell any food, supply any whores, or buy any goods from any of them unless they join Captain Flint's crew and grant him use of their ship. Most of theRangercrew members walk over and stand next to Flint. EvenAnne Bonnybegins to make a move toward Flint, but Vane stops her by threatening to kill her if she moves any further. Eleanor then attempts to console Max and apologizes for what Vane did to her. Max corrects her, stating that it was not his fault this happened, but Eleanor's. Max then tells Vane that because she has cost him his prize, she will remain his until that debt is paid off.\n\nAboard theWalrus, Billy Bones approaches Morley who is standing on watch. Bones begins to question Morley about his loyalty to the Captain. Morley states that he has a right to be dissatisfied and that he believes that, even as bad a person as he was, Singleton was no thief. Bones states that he saw the stolen schedule with his own eyes. Morley concedes that he may be wrong about Singleton, but he is not wrong about Flint. Bones tells Morley that he trusts Flint, but Morley says that the only reason Bones trusts Flint is because he doesn't know about \"Mrs. Barlow\".\n\nThe episode ends with Miranda reading a section from Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations\" to Richard. They are interrupted by the arrival of Flint who takes Miranda into the next room and shuts the door.\n\n",

      "During the meeting between Eleanor and the leadership of theWalrusand theRanger,Vane can be seen rolling a coin between his fingers. Actor Zach McGowan revealed in an interview withInversethat he taught himself the trick on the plane to South Africa, and improvised it in the scene.",
      "Mr. Scott mentions that he can reach out to their contacts in a place called Port Harbour. It's possible he is referring toHarbour Island, considering there is no location by that name in real life.",
      "Benjamin Hornigold is introduced as a somewhat older, very powerful pirate captain in charge of Fort Nassau, which was previously seen in a background shot in the first episode.In real life, Hornigold began his pirate career in 1713, and he was considered one of the founders of thePirate Republicand one of the most powerful pirate captains. He was captain toEdward Teachand taught him everything he knew about pirating, and Teach eventually became his second-in-command. The historical Hornigold was really known not to attack British ships, apparently to maintain the legal defense that he was a privateer operating against England's enemies in the War of the Spanish Succession.In the show, Gates and Hornigold discuss the latter'sJacobitesympathies, Hornigold seemingly having been part of a failed rebellion of theirs. The Jacobites supported the Catholic members of the royalHouse of Stuartwho had been deposed and forbidden from ascending the throne. However, it was only in 1715, the year that the show is taking place, that their main rebellion failed. The closest equivalent would be the 1708 failed invasion, which was supposed to include French assistance. This event seemingly takes the place of the 1715 rebellion.Hornigold reveals that Gates has been at sea for  50 years.Hornigold's ship is called theRoyal Lion,likely a nod to his Jacobite sympathies. In real life, he never captained a ship by this name. His commands included theMarianne,and theRanger.Fort Nassauwas a real fortress that as in the show, guarded the western end of the harbor that was completed in 1697. In real life, after repeated Spanish and French attacks it had fallen into disrepair, although Hornigold led efforts to restore and rearm the fort. The fort was demolished in 1897, and is now the site of the Colonial Hilton Hotel.",
      "Historically, Vane really was deposed as captain by the majority of his crew, who took theRangerand left him only a handful of loyal men. However, it was Jack Rackham who led this move, after Vane was accused of cowardice for attempting to attack a French warship before promptly retreating when realizing what their quarry was."

    "synopsis": "The episode begins with Gates sitting below decks on theWalruslooking over charts.Billy Bonestells him that it is time to go up on the deck and talk to the crew. Up on the deck,Gatesexplains to the crew that since he will be the new captain of the Ranger that they will need a new quartermaster and that nominates Bones. The crew wholeheartedly agrees and cheers for Bones. Bones goes on to tell the crew that if they are going to fight theUrca, that they will first have tocareenthe ship, i.e. scrubs the bottom of the hull. Concerning where they are going to be doing the careening, the ships carpenter,De Groot, disagrees withCaptain Flint'schoice of location, stating that the risk of calamity is too high. However, since finding a new location would take perhaps take two weeks, De Groot's concerns are overruled by the crew. With the location agreed upon, the ship is pulled onto the beach and laid on her side.\n\nOn shore, Bones has a flashback to his conversation withMorleythat he had on deck a week earlier. Morley begins to tell a story about how, several years earlier, Flint convinced the crew to chase after a merchantman, theMaria Aleyne, which was allegedly packed with jewels and gold. Morley continues by saying how the crew tracked the merchantman for months until they finally spotted her. When they attacked they lost several men and yet there was hardly anything on board. He says that while he was exploring below decks he heard a man and woman begging for their lives, screaming \"spare us and our fortune's yours\". He then heard screaming until he saw the murderer leave; it was Captain Flint. Morley tells Bones that once they got back to shore, he saw aladythere waiting for Flint and that when Flint reached her said two words: \"they're dead.\" He says that tracking that ship was never about money, it was an execution. Morley states that he fears that it's all happening again and that good crewmen will die for Mrs. Barlow's agenda.\n\nAt Mrs. Barlow's house, a disinterested Flint is having sex with Barlow. Afterwards, as Flint is getting dressed, Barlow asks him why he is upset with her. He tells her that it's because she read Marcus Aurelius'MeditationswithRichard Guthrie. The book apparently had some significance between Barlow and her former husband, Thomas Hamilton. Barlow tells Flint that she is having trouble remaining in such an uncivilized place. Flint assures her that things will get better.\n\nIn Vane's tent,Rackhamenters to find Vane visibly bruised and beaten. One week without a ship has sent Vane into a tailspin. Rackham tells Vane that he needs to get himself together because Rackham is tired of trying to recover what they have lost just by himself. Looking outside his tent, Vane sees a hulking man staring at him. The man suddenly seems to disappear.\n\nAt Eleanor Guthrie's tavern,HornigoldconfrontsMr. Scott, claiming that Eleanor is out of control after her humiliation of Vane. Hornigold states that several captains are fearful that they too will lose their livelihoods if they catch Eleanor on the wrong day. News arrives that theAndromacheis about to arrive in port. TheAndromacheis the ship captained byDyfed Brysonthat Eleanor wishes to take the large cannons from and give to Flint. Mr. Scott explains to Eleanor that what they are about to attempt with Bryson is very risky and that they cannot under any circumstances try to detain him. He tells her that if they were to make a violent move against Bryson that it would be a direct affront to the Guthrie Trading Company and therefore to her grandfather. Scott insists that Eleanor promise that she understands and that she won't do anything to detain him should he balk. Eleanor promises that she won't try anything like that. As Bryson arrives on the beach, Eleanor is there waiting for him. She tells him that one of their crews plans to hunt theUrca. Bryson seems shocked and states that surely her father wouldn't agree to such a thing. Eleanor tells him that in fact her father does agree and that he wishes to speak to Bryson.\n\nBack on shore, Flint approaches the ship as it lays partially on its side. He comes across a crew member accostingJohn Silverclaiming that his cooking ofpigmeat gave them \"the squirts\". Flint tastes the pig and claims that it tastes good, but when the crew member skulks off, Flint spits it out and tells Silver to get another pig to butcher and that he'll instruct Silver how to cook it properly. Later, Silver witnesses an encounter from afar between Bones and Morley and reports this to Flint. Flint dismisses Silver, stating that he trusts Bones a thousand times more than a rogue like Silver and that attempting to play him against his own crew won't earn Silver any favors. The wind begins to pick up and De Groot looks around nervously at the trees that are holding the ship up on its side.\n\nAt a tent in Nassau,Maxis just finishing having sex with a very happy crewman of the Ranger. She tells him that he should now understand how it will be if she is made to feel comfortable, instead of being abused by them.Hamundenters her tent and as she timidly approaches him, he punches her in the face. Outside the tent, a very uncomfortableAnne Bonnycan hear the sounds of Max's screams.\n\nAt Miranda Barlow's cottage, Mr. Scott arrives to dress Richard Guthrie for the upcoming meeting with Bryson. Guthrie brags to Miranda about what a fine man Mr. Scott is. He states that at one time Mr. Scott was his personal houseboy and that Scott worked his way up into eventually earning an education, which he then passed on to Eleanor. Miranda questions why Guthrie is taking part in the attempt to get Bryson's guns. Guthrie responds that he must present himself as still in command of the functions of the trading company as opposed to being a wanted criminal. Were Bryson to find out that Guthrie was a wanted man, then Bryson would take him back to Boston in shame.\n\nIn the streets of Nassau, Rackham is attempting to get a fellow pirate,Gruenwald, to sell Rackham's goods to Eleanor as if they were his own. Gruenwald tells him that he can't take the risk of Eleanor finding out and ruining him like she ruined Vane. He tells Rackham Eleanor doesn't have a problem with him (Rackham) and that he should just find his own ship to command and branch off from Vane. When Bonny agrees with this, Rackham explains that he hasn't gotten any offers from other crews to come aboard. They are then confronted byNoonan, who runs Eleanor's brothel. Noonan blames Rackham for taking away his best whore, Max, and insinuates that he is thinking about stealing her back. Bonny seems to encourage Noonan to do it. When Rackham confronts Bonny about her encouraging Noonan to move against them, she storms away.\n\nAt Eleanor's tavern, the meeting between the Guthrie’s and Bryson is taking place. Bryson seems stunned that Richard would go along with a plan such as the one to capture theUrca, but Richard tells him that the only thing that matters to him is profit and that they stand to gain quite a bit. Richard then asks to speak to Bryson alone. Bryson then accuses Richard of being desperate. He surmises that with theScarboroughdocked nearby and with Guthrie taking part in such a risky plan, that something must be terribly wrong. Outside the room, Mr. Scott sees several armed guards and realizes that Eleanor has lied to him about her promise to not use force against Bryson should he not comply. Bryson then emerges from the room and tells Eleanor that the guns are hers and that he will begin transporting them to shore later that evening.\n\nAs Richard Guthrie and Mr. Scott walk back to Miranda's cottage, Richard tells Scott that he fears that Eleanor will get herself killed. He states that if she continues on the path she is on, that either the British or the Spanish will kill her. When Scott asks Richard what he told Bryson in private, Richard confides that he has a plan in place that will save Eleanor from herself. He asks Scott to help him.\n\nBack on the beach, Eleanor approaches Flint and tells him that the guns are his and that they just have to wait for them to be delivered. Suddenly, the wind begins to pick up and the trees that are being to support the weight of the ship begin to be uprooted. As the cleaning crew flees from underneath the hull, Randall realizes that his cat, Betsy, is still in the danger zone and he returns to save her. The ship continues to fall over and Randall is trapped underneath by one of his legs. Morley and Flint run to his aid and try to dig him out. At the same time, De Groot has ordered Bones to cut the remaining ropes still tied to the trees, lest the main mast break. As Morley and Flint struggle to free Randall, Silver arrives with his butcher's knife and tosses it to Flint who proceeds to amputate Randall's leg. Just as the ship begins to fall over, Randall and Flint are able to get away, but Morley is trapped underneath and is killed.\n\nAs the men sit on the beach trying to process what has just occurred, Bones confides in Gates that he is starting to believe that Flint is wrong and that he shouldn't support him, but that he can't muster up any nerve to stand against him because he is afraid of him. Seeing Gates and Bones conversing, Flint approaches Silver and asks what he overheard during Bones' earlier conversation with Morley. Silver tells him that he heard them talking about a woman named Barlow.\n\nBack at Miranda's cottage, Richard Guthrie returns from the meeting in town. Guthrie sits down and begins to converse with Miranda, who he calls \"Mrs. Hamilton\". He calls Miranda out for being the former Mrs. Thomas Hamilton, who was the grandson of Alfred Hamilton, the former Lord Proprietor of the Bahamas. Richard then begins to tell how he'd always heard a story about Mrs. Hamilton. He heard that Mrs. Hamilton, long rumored to be the cheating type, had begun an affair with her husband's best friend, a young Royal Navy officer. Upon finding out about the affair, Mr. Hamilton was so overcome with grief that he killed himself. Mrs. Hamilton is then said to have fled London with her lover, who Richard surmises must be Flint. Richard then offers to return her to civilization by taking her to Boston where she can find a fresh start.\n\nInside Vane's tent, Vane begins to have hallucinations of Eleanor. She tells him that he can still take back his position if he'll just try. Once again, he sees the vision of a large man outside his tent. As he approaches the vision it disappears and then reappears at a different location. After following the apparition into an alley, Vane is confronted by Noonan and several of his cronies. They begin to beat Vane and then put a gun to his head and pull the trigger, but the pistol misfires. Vane grabs the pistol and beats one member of Noonan's group, stabs another, and then breaks Noonan's neck with his foot.\n\nLater on that evening, Miranda bringsPastor Lambrickto visit Richard. Richard tells the Pastor that he is ready to begin his redemption from his illicit past. Near the shore,O'Malleystands awaiting the arrival of Bryson's guns. Mr. Scott approaches him and then knocks him out with a rifle butt, and allows Bryson to leave with the cannons.\n\nFrom the shore, one of the men spots the ship leaving. Eleanor recognizes it as theAndromache, but she didn't have the time to unload the cannons. When asked what they are going to do about the ship leaving with their cannons, Flint says the only thing they can do about it is take them back.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens on the sea with theWalrusin hot pursuit on theAndromacheand her 12 pound guns that Flint was promised. On the quarter deck,Captain Flintstates toBilly Bonesthat he is aware that Bones doesn't trust him. With the battle approaching, Flint tries to clear the air between him and Bones. Bones asks Flint who theBarlowwoman is that he has heard about. Flint tells him that the story behind Mrs. Barlow isn't as fantastical as some of the crew thinks. He states the boring truth that she is just a puritan woman that he shares a home with and that the two share a love of books. Suddenly, theAndromacheis spotted on the horizon and the men go to their posts.\n\nVane,Rackham, andAnne Bonnyarrive atNoonan'sbrothel. Much to Bonny's dismay, Rackham and Vane have formulated a plan to take over the recently deceased Noonan's brothel and make it their business. Putting their plan in play, Rackham approachesMrs. Mapletonand hands her an obviously forged bill of transfer from Noonan giving Vane the brothel. Rackham tells a dubious Mapleton that Noonan sold them the brothel and has fled toPort Royal. Mapleton immediately sniffs out that this is a deception but turns it to her advantage, asking for a raise in exchange for her silence on the matter. When Mapleton tells Rackham that she currently makes 3 percent of the gross, Rackham tells her that he'll give her 40.\n\nAtEleanor'stavern, Eleanor is pacing back and forth dismayed thatMr. Scottseems to have disappeared. In one of her rooms, she comes uponJohn Silverwho is sitting on the floor chained to a sleepingRandall. Silver tells Eleanor that Flint commanded that he stay inNassauand not take part in the expedition against theAndromache, lest his brains end up on the deck and that he is chained to recent amputee Randall to ensure that he doesn't run away. When Silver senses that Eleanor has some hostility toward him, he asks her why. She tells him that she blames him for what has happened toMax. They are interrupted byO'Malleywho tells Eleanor that she needs to go outside right away.\n\nOutside,Richard Guthrieis giving a speech to a crowd. He tells them that he is now a fugitive from the law and is facing execution. He tells them that his family in Boston has found out about his fugitive status and sentCaptain Brysonand theAndromachedown to liquidate his holdings. Guthrie tells the crowd that he convinced Bryson to leave their warehouse and that anyone owed credit by the Guthrie's or anyone that has goods in the warehouse should settle it up with Eleanor.\n\nBack on board theWalrus, Captain Flint realizes that his ship isn't closing the gap between their prey, theAndromache.\n\nTo gain more speed, Flint orders the t'gallants to be raised. This is a risky move as it may make the ship so unstable that the rigging will snap, but Flint knows it is the only way to gain the extra knot they need in order to catch theAndromache. TheWalrusbegins to take a beating from the t'gallants being raised, but the crew eventually manages to stabilize her and upon testing, it is revealed that she is now making seven and a half knots, more than enough to catch theAndromachebefore nightfall.\n\nBack at Eleanor's tavern, Richard approaches Eleanor. Eleanor curses him for sending Bryson's ship away and for lying right to her face. Richard tells her that she is a fool for letting Flint seduce her in his mad quest for theUrca de Lima. Richard tells her that Flint will likely come back from his pursuit of theAndromacheempty handed or not at all and that'll be the end of his quest for theUrca de Lima. He tells her that he has a plan in place that will let them remain in power on the island. He states that he has made allies with many of the large land owners on the island and that when British rule comes to the island, they can make money the legitimate way.\n\nOutside on the streets,Captain Lilywhiteis rabble rousing and getting the crowd into a fury as he condemns the Guthrie's, stating that the Guthrie's have always been crooked, but now they are straight up thieving from them. As a member of the mob attempts to physically assault Eleanor, he is stopped byCaptain Hornigold, who tells Eleanor that he and his crew will man the tavern in order to keep tempers from boiling over. He tells Eleanor that she must hurry up and square up with those that she owes money to. She tells Hornigold that she has no money to pay them back with. She then calls for a meeting with the leadership of theIntrepidand theBlack Hind, as well asFrasierand Captain Hornigold.\n\nAt the brothel,Hamundannounces that Eleanor Guthrie is finished and now that they are rid of her, Rackham needs to find them a ship. Rackham suggests that they exercise caution, being that Hornigold is apparently still backing her. This doesn't sit well with Hamund and he storms off to go attack Eleanor. Bonny offers to kill Hamund but Rackham tells her that they can't go around killing the few men they still have left that are loyal to Vane. Rackham tells Bonny to get Mrs. Mapleton out to the beach to check on Max.\n\nOn the beach, Mrs. Mapleton enters the tent where Max is being held. She proceeds to use a large syringe like device to inject Max with a chemical that is intended to keep her from becoming pregnant. This causes Max great pain. Bonny orders Mapleton to leave the tent and continues the treatment, although with a gentler touch that doesn't harm Max. Bonny begins to question Max about why she didn't leave when she had the opportunity (when Eleanor saved her from Hamund). When Max asks why Bonny cares, Bonny tells her that one time a man put his balls on her while she was sleeping and that upon finding out, she cut them off. Bonny then encourages Max to defend herself the next time she is assaulted.\n\nBack at Eleanor's tavern, Eleanor is preparing for her meeting. Silver tells her that he doesn't think she is taking the threat of the mob very seriously and that she obviously hasn't ever seen a mob turn. Hamund then barges in and threatens Eleanor before O'Malley orders him out. Hamund jokes that he should go spend some more time with their friend on the beach (Max).\n\nAt the brothel,Idelleenters Vane's room to tend to his wounds. When Idelle states her disdain for Eleanor, Vane tells her that even though everyone hates her, Eleanor still has all the power, and that hating Eleanor hasn't gotten anyone anywhere. He states that no one has the power to take her on. Idelle suggests that Vane has that power. Vane says that it's probably time that he found out.\n\nAt Eleanor's tavern, Eleanor informs those captains present that she intends to carry on the family business without her father. She states that she wishes to form a consortium with everyone sharing in the profits. Eleanor tells Hornigold that she desperately needs a respected captain like him to back her. Hornigold tells Eleanor that he will only back her if she lifts the ban on Vane. Eleanor adamantly rejects his proposal.\n\nAboard theWalrus, Bones,Logan, andDufresneare going over the ship's supplies. They are bare. Logan explains that when they careened the ship, they had to take many of the supplies off the ship. Bones then hands Dufresne a pistol and tells him that they are going to need every man and that he must participate in the upcoming battle against theAndromache. On the top deck, Bones explains the tactics of the upcoming battle to the crew. He explains that the key to getting close enough to board theAndromachewill beBeauclerc, the ship's sharpshooter. As the meeting ends, a nervous Dufresne approaches Bones and shows him how much that he has saved the crew through his wits and therefore should stick to keeping records and not participating in battles. Bones tells him that everyone must do their part and that Dufresne is long overdue for his first battle.\n\nAs theWalruscomes within range of theAndromache'sguns, Bryson orders his ship to swing to port to fire full broadsides at theWalrus. These shots hit home hard and numerousWalruscrew members are wounded. Despite the damage, theWalruscontinues to sail straight at theAndromache. Flint orders Beauclerc to shoot the helmsman, thus leaving the rudder unattended wherein theAndromachewill be blown by the wind into the direction of theWalrus. Beauclerc must shoot two helmsmen before the plan finally succeeds. As the ships begin to close with each other, the crew of theWalrusswings hooks and nets onto theAndromache. Dufresne is scared out of his wits and the prospect of having to swing over to another ship and engage in close combat. Despite his fear, he jumps over to theAndromacheand engages in the battle. Luckily, an enemy sailor's pistol misfires as he points it point blank in Dufresne's face. Dufresne and the sailor begin hand to hand combat, with Dufresne eventually killing the man when he bites into the man's neck.\n\nThe crew of theWalrushas successfully taken over the top deck of theAndromache, but are struggling getting into the cargo hold, where they know the majority of her crew is hiding, along with Captain Bryson. Below decks Bryson and his crew are indeed hiding and it is then revealed that they are transporting dozens of slaves. Among the slaves sits Mr. Scott. Bryson apologizes to Scott, but states that Guthrie told him that no matter what, Bryson must have Scott on board theAndromachewhen he left. Bryson then forces a slave to go up on the top deck with a message for Flint.Joshuatranslates the message. The message states that before he leftNassau, Bryson sent word to theScarboroughof the exact location where he was heading. Just then, theScarboroughis sighted on the horizon heading toward the ships. After reading the message, the slave then charges at Flint with a grenade, but Bones shoots the man dead before he can reach Flint.\n\n",

In an attempt to blow a hole in the hold whereDyfed Brysonand his men are hiding, they cover an African crewmen,Lars, with a black soot in hopes that he can get close enough to throw the grenade. Lars is spotted byHayesand shot to death. Meanwhile, Bryson prepares something with flintlocks.\n\nDeep below decks, several of the slaves, including a female namedEme, are trying to convinceMr. Scottto help them in their efforts to escape. Mr. Scott rejects their requests. The slaves manage to stick a cloth out of one of the portholes. They hope that one of theWalruscrew will see that it is a sign of distress from slaves and come to their aid.\n\nInside of the Guthrie tavern, a large crowd awaitsEleanor'sdecision about the deal proposed in episodeV.Several captains discuss how long it is taking her to say something. After some time, she exits from her office. Eleanor nods in agreement to the deal, andCaptain Hornigoldsays that he will tell the good news toCaptain Lilywhite.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau,Hamundreturns from the tavern with the news of Eleanor \"knuckling under\".Anne Bonnystands in front of the tent whereMaxis being held. After a confrontation,Jack Rackhamattempts to dissuade Anne from defending Max again. Anne regretfully agrees to stand down, and Hamund enters the tent again, presumably to rape Max.\n\nBack on theAndromache,Billy Bonesinvestigates aletterhe has found in Captain Bryson's quarters that is fromMiranda Barlow. It is a letter to the authorities in Massachusetts asking for leniency on Captain Flint, stating that he is a good man and is eager to repent his transgressions at sea. It ends very dubiously with the words: \"He is caught in a dangerous plot with wicked men who will most certainly kill him when they learn of his betrayal.\" Bones pulls Gates to the side and shows him the letter and continues to voice his concern about Flint potentially playing with the lives of the crew. Gates tells him that they are in the middle of a battle and that he can do nothing about it at the moment.\n\nAt Miranda Barlow's cottage,Pastor Lambrickarrives late at night. He tells Barlow that he fears for her safety after finding out that she had been harboringRichard Guthrie. He states that he fears that eventually Flint will do some harm to her. Barlow then explains her relationship with Flint and her backstory of how she was widowed while in London and that Flint brought her toNassau. She tells Lambrick that Flint was her \"deliverer\" and there is nothing more that he needs to know. Barlow then asks Lambrick why he isreallythere so late at night. When he responds that he merely wants to protect her, Barlow rejects this and tells him that what he really wants is to have sex with her. She then seduces him and the two have sex, albeit very briefly, on her front porch.\n\nAt Eleanor's tavern, Eleanor is confronted by Anne Bonny who tells her that the treatment Max is receiving on the beach from Hamund isn't right and needs to be remedied. Bonny asks that Eleanor kill Hamund. Eleanor rejects this idea and suggests that they wipe out all of the remainingRangercrew that are still loyal toVane. To assist her, Eleanor enlists the help ofJohn Silver, who is still locked up in Eleanor's office. Though he initially rejects the idea, Eleanor convinces him to help her when she tells him that he is eventually going to need friends to protect him from being disposed of once he has outlived his usefulness to Flint.\n\nBack aboard theAndromache, Gates proposes that four men dangle from ropes over the edge of the ship and try to cut holes into her side. When no one volunteers for the assignment, Flint picks four men, includingLogan. Logan immediately rejects the idea, stating that it is suicide and tries to enlist Bones' support. As Bones begins to talk to Flint, Gates jumps in and punches Logan and reminds everyone that when they are in a battle, they must follow the captain's orders, even unto their death. The crew is then alerted to the fact that there are slaves in the hold of the ship when someone spots the white cloth that Eme had hanged out the porthole. Flint looks at the manifest of theAndromacheand sees that there are 38 slaves in the hold, including nine priced over 100 pounds, meaning that those nine are strong men. Flint tells Gates that he thinks that those men would jump at the chance to join the fight against Bryson.\n\nBelow decks, Eme continues in her attempt to get Mr. Scott to help her and the other slaves escape. Just then, a crewman from theWalruspushes amarling spikethrough the porthole. Having heard the noise that the tool made as it hit the deck, a member of theAndromache'screw enters the hold to investigate. Mr. Scott tells him that Eme is the one that caused the disturbance. When the man lifts Eme up and turns his back on the rest of the slaves, Mr. Scott jumps up from behind and strangles the man with his chains. Up on the top deck, the crew of theWalrusbegins hitting the deck with their axes with a particular rhythm. The slaves then realize that this is to disguise the noise of them breaking their chains.\n\nWhen he realizes that something must be wrong, Bryson sends Hayes and a few other crewmen down into the hold to investigate. When they arrive in the hold, they are quickly overwhelmed and killed by the recently freed slaves. The slaves and Mr. Scott then rush into the room where the crew of theAndromacheare hiding and begin a fight. Soon after, the crew of theWalrus, led by Joshua, burst into the room and finishes the fight. During the fight, Bryson is shot in the face with a pistol. He survives the gunshot and begins to crawl toward the explosive trap he set with the flintlocks. Before he can reach it, he is assaulted by Eme who drives the marling spike into his back, killing him.\n\nBack in Nassau, Silver approaches Hamund and states that he has a proposition for him. He tells Hamund that he was Max's partner and that he wants to sell the information of the schedule to him. When Hamund tells Flint that he doesn't have any money because Rackham lost it all, Silver tells him that's not exactly true. Hamund and the others barge in on Bonny and Rackham as they are lying together in bed. Silver apparently told them that Rackham gave half the pearls to Max before he ever went to the meeting atThe Wreckswhich means that there is still 2,500 pesos out there that Max had on her and that this means that Bonny or Rackham still have them because they must have surely taken them from Max. Hamund then produces a handful of pearls that he found in Rackham's tent as proof that Rackham is lying. When Hamund asks where the rest of the pearls are, Bonny tells him that they buried them at The Wrecks and that she can lead him to them.\n\nBack on theAndromache, Flint approaches Mr. Scott and states his astonishment at finding Scott in the hold, especially after he sold Eleanor out. Scott tells Flint that his agreement with Mr. Guthrie was that he was stay behind with Eleanor to protect her from Flint. Flint tells him that since he just lost six of his crew chasing down theAndromachethat he should just throw Scott to them, but he states that he isn't going to do that. Instead, he wants to keep Mr. Scott alive just to show Scott that he and Eleanor will be successful in their plan to capture theUrcaand to make Nassau a pirate nation.\n\nBelow decks, two members of the crew find a powder keg and decide to take it. They are unaware that lifting the powder keg ignites an explosive device. This was the device that Bryson was crawling toward when Eme killed him. The explosion is massive and nearly blows apart theAndromache. However, more damning than the loss of theAndromacheto the crew of theWalrusis that the explosion has surely been seen by theScarboroughin the blackness of night.\n\nFlint orders that the ships be cut loose from each other and theWalrusraises sails and shoves off and sails away as fast as she can. Unfortunately, their progress is being slowed by a piece of theAndromachethat has been blown into some of the rigging of theWalrus. Flint and Bones realize that they must cut the piece of theAndromacheoff the ship and begin cutting the ropes. While they are cutting, Flint tells Bones that earlier when Gates was talking to Bones, he overheard them mention a letter. Flint demands that Bones tell him what was in the letter. Before Bones can answer him, a volley of cannon fire from theScarboroughhits theWalrus. When the cannonballs hit, Bones apparently fell overboard. As the crew rush to look into the sea, Gates states that the ship can't turn back to potentially rescue him because theScarboroughwould tear them to pieces.\n\nAtThe Wrecks, the crew of theRangeris being led by Bonny to where she \"buried\" the pearls. Rackham comes alongside her and quietly tells her that he knows this must be an ambush of some sort. Bonny tells him that she partnered with Eleanor in the endeavor. Rackham begs thatSladebe spared because he never laid a hand on Max, but Anne more or less states that all must die.O'Malleyand several other men that work for Eleanor emerge from behind hidden rocks and begin killing theRangercrew. Hamund tries to limp away but Bonny catches him and stabs him in the gut with her cutlass, killing him.\n\nAboard theWalrus, the men are holding a memorial service and burial at sea for those members of the crew that they lost in the battle with theAndromache. When they get to Billy Bones, because there is no body to bury, they throw his cutlass into the water.\n\nAt the brothel, Max slowly walks up the stairs to her room, accompanied by Bonny. She thanks Bonny for what she did for her. Bonny states that she didn't do it for Max, but that she did it for herself. Max enters her room and collapses to the floor, content to being back home. Bonny goes downstairs and takes a seat at a table with Rackham. Rackham asks her what she said to Eleanor and now that she knows where his loyalty lies, which is with her and not his crew, and that once he knows of the crews plan he would notify them. Bonny responds that she always knew that Rackham would choose her over them. Rackham then asks what she is going to tell Vane when he returns and finds out about all this. Bonny laughs at Rackham and declares that he obviously has no idea where Vane has gone.\nAboard his skiff, Vane sails into a murky and dark swamp. Walking ashore he approaches a campfire and it is revealed thatAlbinusis there waiting for him.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode begins withPastor Lambrickgiving one of his sermons, alone and in a cane field. He is sweating profusely. He appears to be inflicting a penance on himself for his sinful act withMiranda Barlow. Suddenly aslaveon a horse bursts through the cane on his way to Barlow's cottage. He arrives and tells her thatCaptain Flinthas returned.\n\nAtEleanor'stavern,Gates,Silver, and Flint sit in Eleanor's office. Eleanor is asking Flint about how theScarboroughmanaged to find them. Flint tells her that it was herfather'sdoing and that her father will have to answer to him as soon as he sees him. Eleanor responds by pointing out that Barlow should also be questioned because Mr. Guthrie was under her care. Eleanor proceeds to tell Flint about the changes that have occurred while he was gone, such as her father leaving and her forming the new consortium. Before Flint leaves, Eleanor bring up to him the fact that Silver was of great help in helping her sort things out the past few days. She states that in lieu of his help to her, she demands that Flint not ever harm him, else it might hurt her relationship with Flint. Flint seems to reluctantly agree.\n\nIn their room,Anne BonnyandRackhamare on the bed having sex. When Rackham is no longer able to perform, Bonny berates him. Rackham apologizes and explains that he has a lot on his mind, such as having to find a new crew and what he is going to tellVaneonce he returns. He is also puzzled by the lack of profit coming in from the brothel. Bonny says that he'll figure it out and leaves the room, with Rackham still tied to the bed.\n\nInside her room,Maxis sitting staring out the window.Idelleenters, bringing Max food. She tells Max that all the girls in the brothel are talking about what Max is going to do next. She states that the girls all wonder what kind of voodoo Max used to get all her abusers to up and disappear. Max tells her that they've all gone toPort Royal. Idelle then tells Max that if she ever wants to work again, she better hurry up and get busy because Rackham has no idea how to run a brothel and the girls are barely reporting any of their earnings to him.\n\nOn the beach,Dufresnesits while a tattoo of ashark'smouth is placed on his arm. He is also sporting a very shortly cropped new hairdo. He explains to Gates that his new hairdo is a post-election initiation. FollowingBones'sdisappearance, the crew has elected Dufresne asQuartermasterof theWalrus.\n\nGates then corners Flint in a cabin and says that they need to discuss the letter that Bones found from Barlow stating that Flint is going to betray his crew. Flint has difficulty answering Gates's questions about Barlow, stating that their relationship is so complex that he has trouble figuring it out for himself. Gates then asks about what happened the night before with Bones falling overboard. He insinuates that Flint had something to do with it. He then tells Flint that he knows what happened on theMaria Aleyne. He states that he knows that they captured that ship just so Flint could murder certain people on the ship. He tells Flint that Bones was like a son to him. Flint responds by saying that if that were the case, then Gates should have been a better father to Bones and not let his suspicions run rampant. Gates then says that he is tired of expending the energy required to keep believing in Flint's promises.\n\nWhen Gates tells Flint that he is going to take everything about the letter and Bones to the crew, Flint stops him and admits that he is taking the prize money for himself. He states that he is going to put the prize money in a warehouse and then sequester a portion of it away from the crew. He says that he knows the crew will just drink, whore, and piss all their money away. He wants to keep a portion to be used for creating a safe place for the men to live in. Gates finally states that he will sail with Flint to take the prize, but after that, they are done working together.\n\nElsewhere on the beach,Randallis in a panic trying to get at Silver. He is being held back byDe GrootandDr. Howell. De Groot tells Silver that Randall has been voted out by the ship's council because a one legged crew member is a liability aboard the ship. De Groot says that Randall wishes to speak to Silver and that the least Silver could do is honour that request. When Silver approaches Randall, Randall immediately begins calling out Silver as a thief. He states that when he was recovering from his amputation, he heard all about Silver's involvement with the theft of the schedule. Silver tries to play it off as Randall making things up due to Randall being on pain killing opiates the past two days. Before Silver can leave, De Groot grabs him and calls for the quartermaster.\n\nWhen Dufresne arrives, Dr. Howell and De Groot realize that they are the only members of the crew who know about Randall's accusations against Flint. They then consider what's at stake: the prize money. If they tell the other members of the crew about what Randall has said, then surely Silver and Flint will be immediately hanged as liars and that would therefore mean no prize money because the hunt for theUrca de Limawould surely end. They eventually come up with a test to give to Silver to see if his brain really is capable of memorizing something in a short time. They attempt to have him memorize a page from one of Dr. Howell's medical books in five minutes. Silver tells them that this is hardly a fair test because he had days with theUrca'sschedule where he could have memorized it. Nevertheless, he attempts the test. After taking the test, Silver confronts Dufresne and states that Dufresne would never have administered such a test if he did not think that Silver was the thief. Thus, he asks Dufresne who told him about him. Silver suggests that it must have been Bones. Dufresne has no answer for him.\n\nDesperate, Silver attempts to convince Randall to change his story for the sake of both of their lives. Knowing that Randall, above all else, desires to be a member of the crew, Silver offers that if Randall changes his story, that he will offer to the crew that he be placed in charge of Randall and that if anything were to happen to Randall, that it would come out of Silver's share. Thus, he offers Randall a chance to get back on the ship if he will only just change his story. When Dufresne and the others enter the tent with the bad news that Silver did not pass their test, Randall begins pointing at everyone and calling them thieves. Everyone then believes that crazy Randall was just being crazy Randall when he originally accused Silver.\n\nInside Eleanor's tavern, a meeting of the consortium is being held.Captain Naftclumsily states that the name that he has come up with for their new consortium: \"The Guthrie Frasier Naft Lawrence Consortium for the Purposes of Shipping and Trade in the West Indes, Excelsior.\" When the silence from the others overwhelms him, Naft asks that a new name be looked into during their next meeting. Naft then asksCaptain Lawrencewhat the status of his ship, theBlack Hind, is. Lawrence states that a good number of his crew defected when they were offered the chance to be legitimate sailors and that theBlack Hindcurrently is undermanned.\n\nEleanor is called outside of the meeting byO'Malleywho tells her thatMr. Scottis downstairs. When she confronts Scott, Eleanor tells him that she has heard all about his deeds in leading the revolt by the slaves aboard theAndromache. Scott then tells Eleanor that everything he did against her was actually done out of love for her. His chief concern is always her safety and well being. When Eleanor asks him if he thinks he can just waltz back in there and everything will be OK, Scott responds by telling her \"where else would I go?\". It is then revealed that he is still a slave and is property of the Guthrie estate. Eleanor tells him that she has never seen him in that way. Scott then tells Eleanor that he has a favor he'd like to ask of her.\n\nSomewhere in a highly forested area, Vane awakens to a boy standing over him. The boy tells Vane thatAlbinusis waiting on him. Vane tells Albinus about Nassau's vulnerability and that he wishes to use some of Albinus's men to crew his ship. He offers to give Albinus a share for every six men that he is given. Before answering, Albinus then asks Vane how he knew where to find him. He asks what their connection is. Vane tells him that it doesn't matter. Albinus then agrees, but only if he gets one share per every three men he gives Vane.\n\nWhen Albinus is giving his men to Vane, he realizes that Vane bears a brand upon his chest that all of the other young men in bondage under Albinus have. Albinus says that Vane was \"one of ours\" and that it must have taken great strength to come back to that place. When Albinus walks off, Vane then begins to give a speech to his new men. He tells them that they used to be a strong pirate crew and can now, under him, return to terrorizing the sea as they once did. He states that they now have the chance to be free men again, and be as they once were, before Albinus dragged them to that place and made them manual laborers. Albinus then runs up to Vane and the two begin to fight. While Vane originally has the upper hand, the tide turns against him and he is beaten to a bloody mess by Albinus who, before giving the coup de' grace kick to Vane's head, tells Vane that he is proud of him. Vane's lifeless body is then thrown into a shallow grave.\n\nBack in Nassau, Mr. Scott brings food to the slaves who have been now moved on shore. He talks toEmeand tells her that he is attempting to gain their freedom somehow because if the slaves hadn’t helped overthrow theAndromachethat Eleanor wouldn't have the guns that she needs for the expedition. As he is leaving, Scott is confronted byCaptain Hornigold. Hornigold tells Scott that he needs Scott's help in trying to figure out how to control Eleanor, although Hornigold eventually concedes that there probably is no way to control her.\n\nLater, Scott is summoned into Eleanor's office. She tells him that she has given the able bodied male slaves to Captain Lawrence to replace the depleted crew on theBlack Hind. The females will now be under her employ at the tavern. Scott is obviously very pleased with this. When Eleanor asks that Scott come back as her adviser, he tells her that he has joined Captain Hornigold's crew. He states that as long as she is working with Flint, he will always be tempted to interfere.\n\nAt Barlow's cottage, Flint storms in looking for Richard Guthrie. Barlow tells him that Guthrie has absconded and is now staying with Mr. Underhill. Flint then demands to know why Barlow sent that letter when it so obviously placed him in danger if the crew were to find it. Barlow tells Flint that her intent in writing the letter was to show Flint that there was a way out of the pirate life, to show him that they could be accepted in Boston if Flint were to accept the King's pardon. Flint emphatically states that he would never beg for the King's pardon.\n\nAt the brothel, Rackham is attempting to fire one of the prostitutes who isn't pulling her keep. A prostitute namedAlicethen walks up and gives Rackham five gold pieces. Max then appears and asks Alice who she just serviced. Max states that it was Captain Hallindale who she saw leaving Alice's room. Hallindale has a very specific service that he always requests and that he always pays 20 gold pieces. Realizing that she is caught, Alice apologizes to Rackham and states that it will never happen again. Max then berates Rackham and tells him to get his house in order.\n\nAt Eleanor's tavern, Eleanor is cleaning up when she comes upon a drunken Captain Flint. She asks how wise it is for him to get drunk when he is about to embark upon the most dangerous mission of his career. Flint then expresses much doubt in what he and Eleanor are trying to do to change Nassau. Eleanor insists that she believes Flint is the only person who can do the things necessary to make Nassau a better place. Flint kisses her on the forehead and then leaves.\n\nThe next day, theWalrusand theRangerare preparing to cast off. Below decks, Silver suggests that, given what he has seen, he believes that Randall is not as stupid or crazy as people believe. He goes on to surmise that Randall is actually a genius and that he has just been playing dumb as a way to remain on the crew and still profit without incurring the extra risk. Randall's only response to being called a genius is to break wind.\n\nOn the quarter deck of theWalrus, Flint looks over to theRangerat Gates. There is then a flashback to the previous night with Gates and Dufresne at a tavern. When Gates asks about the situation with Silver, Dufresne says that it has all been resolved, but admits that Silver was aware that Dufresne knew about the page, but that Silver assumed his knowledge came from Bones. Dufresne's knowledge of the page actually came from Gates. Dufresne then tells Gates that De Groot and Dr. Howell are sceptical of Gates's ability to do what is necessary when the time is right, i.e. to kill Flint. Gates reassures Dufresne that there will not be a problem from him on that account. Flash forward to the present and the two ships sail off to chase theUrca.\n\nInside of his shallow grave, Vane comes to life. He hears Eleanor's voice telling him that he could be strong; that he could take the whole island from her if he was not so afraid. Vane emerges from the grave. A nude and dirt-covered Vane then sneaks up behind Albinus and stabs him through the back with a wooden stake.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode begins inRackham'sbrothel during a severe thunderstorm. Rackham requests to speak toMrs. Mapleton. He has decided to stop paying the 40% distribution of house profits that he promised her in exchange for her silence regarding the murder of Noonan. When he attempts to fire her, she threatens to tell all the merchants on the island about how he came to control the brothel.Maxarrives and calls Mapleton's bluff, asking her who she is going to tell on the island? She points out that all of the merchants on the island are now receiving tremendous discounts at the brothel and are unlikely to care how Rackham came into business.\n\nAboard theWalrus, the crew are making the best of the thunderstorm and are enjoying themselves below deck, playing cards and listening to music.Silveris attempting to getRandallto wear a prosthetic leg thatDr. Howellhas fashioned for him. Randall will have none of it and throws it on the floor.\n\nInside Captain Flint's cabin, Flint and Gates await Silver. When he arrives, Flint asks for the last bit of theUrca'sschedule that Silver had memorized. Flint states that he is going to cross check Silver's memorized schedule with an actual map of the coast to see if they match up. They do. Silver asks Flint about where they stand now that Silver has upheld his final bit of the bargain that is keeping him alive. Flint tells him to keep wondering and orders him to take the new sailing coordinates toDe Groot. Before Gates is to head back to theRanger, Flint asks him to have a drink with him. Flint and Gates then start drinking heavily and reminiscing on old shipmates that they used to know.\n\nAt Eleanor's tavern,Mr. Scottarrives in Eleanor's office. Eleanor expresses her concern with the storm, which she calls a \"ship killer.\" Eleanor tells Scott how sad she is about all the strife that the schedule has caused between her and Scott and her and Max. Scott tells her that trouble might have found them anyways, regardless of the schedule.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, as Rackham takes a bath,Anne Bonny, distraught that Rackham has fired Mrs. Mapleton given all the secrets she knows about them. When Rackham says he does not care, Bonny begins to suspect that all of his nonchalance has to do with Max. She suggests that Rackham must have slept with Max. After Rackham denies this, Bonny storms off. As she is leaving the brothel, she spies a naked Max and stops to look. Max catches her staring and smiles at her.\n\nThe next day on the beach, the members of Eleanor's shipping consortium are on the docks biddingCaptain Lawrencegood luck on the first voyage of a ship in the consortium. Suddenly, guns begin to fire at the ships in the harbor fromHornigold'sfortress overlooking the town. When Eleanor asks Hornigold why his men are firing on the ship, he states that it is not his men. Mr. Scott takes Eleanor off the shore and out of danger.\n\nOn the sea, theWalrusand theRangerare approaching Division Bay, where they suspect theUrcato be. However, when they make the turn into the bay, the Urca is nowhere to be seen. The leadership then must decide what to do to keep the men from revolting. Flint determines that they should maintain their position and send out scouts to attempt to locate theUrca.DufresneapproachesGatesand tells him that De Groot is demanding that they inform the crew right away of Flint's past treachery. Gates tells him that it is not in the best interest of the crew and the mission to tell the crew about Flint just yet. Gates tells Dufresne that they will try Flint for his crimes back at home and like civilized men. Gates then hands him a document and leaves.\n\nSuddenly,Loganspots sails to the south. It is determined that it is not theUrcabut is a Spanish man-of-war, possibly an escort of theUrca. Flint quickly calculates a plan of action. TheRangerwill raise the black flag and will fire a few shots across the bow of theWalrus. Presumably, because theWalrusis flying a fake Spanish flag, theMan O' Warwill believe that it is a Spanish ship being attacked by a pirate. As theMan O' Wargets closer, theRangerwill take off as if trying to get away. Then when theWalrushas successfully deceived theMan O' Warinto thinking that they are just a Spanish merchant ship, theMan O' Warwill leave theWalrusand chase theRanger. When this happens, theWalruswill turn quickly and fire a broadside into the exposed stern of theMan O' War, while theRangerturns to port and fires against theMan O' War's bow.\n\nBefore the plan is put into play, Gates demands to see Flint in private. Gates tells Flint that he cannot let Flint go down this road. Gates states that he is taking theRangerand will try to get away. Flint tells him that he will have no chance to defeat the Spanish ship if theRangersails away. Finally, when Flint accuses Gates of disobeying orders and starting a mutiny, Gates admits that he is managing a mutiny. He tells Flint about Dufresne and De Groot and the others on the crew that know about Flint's lies and deceptions regardingSingletonandBilly Bones. As Gates goes to leave the room, Flint grabs him from behind and chokes him and eventually breaks his neck. As Flint holds his dead friend's body in his arms, he apologizes and begins to cry. Just then, Silver enters the cabin. When Flint explains that there is no way out of this, Silver tells him that there is always a way out.\n\nFlint emerges from his cabin and tells Dufresne and the others that Gates's heart has given out and that he has died. He then orders Logan to tell theRangerabout the battle plan. When Dufresne enters the cabin to view Gates's body, Silver is there waiting for him. Silver attempts to talk sense to Dufresne and asks Dufresne what good can come from telling the truth about Flint to the crew at a moment such as this, when they are about to go into battle against aMan O' War. Dufresne appears to agree and walks back out onto the deck and tells Flint the best way to go about pretending to be a Spanish merchantman.\n\nBack in Nassau, members of the consortium are standing in Eleanor's tavern trying to figure out what to do about the men in the fort. Hornigold tells her that he has 250 men assembled and ready to storm the fort in the morning. Outside on the street stands Vane and his crew. Vane shouts up at Eleanor that it is time to talk. Inside Eleanor's office, Eleanor meets with Vane. He tells her that all he wants is to be a partner in her new enterprise. He tells her that she cannot attempt to overthrow the fort because before she'll be able to overtake the fort, he can sink half the ships in the harbor. Eleanor concedes to his demand to be a partner.\n\nAt Rackham's brothel, Vane arrives and begins to question Rackham about the disappearance ofHamundand the rest of his former crew. Vane then tells Rackham that an offense like the one he has committed deserves an answer. However, Vane decides not to kill Rackham, but rather decides to leave him in charge of the brothel. Vane tells Rackham that he will tell everyone on the island about how Rackham chose his lover (Bonny) over his crew, virtually condemning Rackham to a lifetime without ever being able to raise a crew or be trusted by another.\n\nOn the sea, the Spanish ship pulls alongside theWalrus. Silver, who speaks Spanish, sets Flint's plan in motion by convincing the ship that theWalrusis a fellow Spanish ship under attack from the fleeingRanger. The Spanish ship buys the ruse and takes off after theRanger. Flint then commands the crew to their stations and orders that they will commence firing on the Spanish ship at 300 yards. Right at 300 yards as the crew are about to fire their cannons, Dufresne pulls a pistol on Flint. He states that as quartermaster of the ship, he accuses Flint of tyrannical acts against his own crew. Flint ignores him and orders that the crew open fire. No one fires. Dufresne pulls out a letter that was written by Gates and given to him, stating all of Flint's crimes and acknowledging his own complicity in those crimes. He continues, telling the crew that the letter also contains information about how Flint is planning to steal a portion of theUrca'streasure for himself. Flint then attempts to fire one of the cannons by himself, but is shot in the shoulder by Dufresne.\n\nBelow decks, De Groot confronts Silver with a pistol, telling Silver that he too will pay for his crimes soon enough. When De Groot is momentarily distracted by the gunshot up on deck, Silver jumps him and the two begin to struggle fiercely. De Groot eventually overpowers Silver and right before he shoots him, Randall appears and strikes De Groot over the head with his artificial leg. He tells Silver, \"you're welcome.\".\n\nEven though he has been shot, Flint is still attempting to fire a cannon and once again Dufresne stops him from doing so. Suddenly, a cannon fires near the stern. It is Silver who fired the shot. Now, with their true identity revealed to the Spanish ship, theWalrusmust open fire and go along with the plan. Dufresne orders that all guns open fire. The fire does not seem to have much of an effect on the Spanish ship. Slowly, the Spanish ship turns where it can broadside both theWalrusand theRanger. The Spanish ship fires and totally rips apart theWalrus, killing and wounding scores of her crew. Flint is blown overboard and with no hope left, appears to let himself sink into the abyss.\n\nSuddenly, Flint awakes to find himself lying on the beach next to Silver. Silver points him to theWalrus, which is still intact, but has been beached on the shore. He tells Flint that they have both been charged by the crew with provoking this mess. Dufresne approaches and Flint asks Dufresne why he is still alive and why they have not yet killed him. Dufresne then takes Flint to a bluff on the beach. Once on the bluff, Flint sees theUrca de Lima, which has apparently wrecked itself on the shore during the storm of the previous night. Gold lays strewn everywhere on the beach.

    "synopsis": "The episode begins upon an English merchantman, theGood Fortuneas they anxiously await to be boarded by a pirate ship commanded byNed Low. The captain of theGood Fortunetells his crew that if they behave rationally that the pirates will likely not inflict harm upon them. Once Low's crew has boarded, they round up the merchantman's crew. Originally intending to show them mercy, Low changes his mind and has the crew and the captain killed when he realizes that there is a special cargo aboard: a young sickly female namedAbigail Ashe. Following the murder of the entire ship's crew, Low orders that theGood Fortunebe set ablaze.\n\nUpon the beach, Flint and the rest of the survivors of theWalrusrealize that theUrca de Limahas shipwrecked and her massive treasure hold washed ashore. However, theSpanish Man O' Warwhich nearly destroyed theWalruswatches over the beach and her crew is attempting to salvage the gold for themselves. Flint proposes to the remainingWalruscrew that the only way they can get off the beach is to take over the Spanish Man'o'War. He proposes that two men may be able to swim undetected out to the Spanish ship and overtake the skeleton crew that was left aboard as the rest of the Spaniards are ashore attempting to recover the gold. In exchange for a pardon from theWalruscrew, Flint volunteers himself for the mission. Silver then volunteers for the second spot.\n\nA flashback shows Flint as aRoyal Navylieutenant inLondonin 1705. He meets LordThomas Hamilton, who wants to exterminate piracy in the West Indies.\n\nIn Nassau, Eleanor arrives atHornigold's fortress, which is currently being controlled by Vane. Eleanor complains that Vane has not been coming to the Consortium's meetings. Vane returns the complaints and states that he believes that Eleanor has no desire to attend and run boring meetings. He opines that she would rather be like him and take what she wants, when she wants. Finally, before Eleanor leaves, Vane asks her if she thinks he is going to let Flint back into the bay whenever he returns with the Spanish gold, if he even returns at all.\n\nOnce they're alone on the beach, Flint berates Silver for volunteering, wishing that someone who could actually fight would be accompanying him. Surprised, Silver states that he didn't actually think Flint was serious and that this was just an elaborate ruse by Flint to escape the justice of theWalrus'crew. Nevertheless, Flint dives into the water and swims toward the Spanish ship, with Silver following not far behind.\n\nIn another flashback, Flint shows the hanging of a pirate to Lord Hamilton. As the crowd cheers when the pirate is hanged, Flint tells Hamilton that pirates are needed, because the civilized world likes the shows like the one they just witnessed.\n\nAs they arrive at the Spanish ship and pull themselves aboard, Flint and Silver find themselves in the precarious spot of being in a room full of Spanish sailors quietly sleeping in their hammocks.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, Rackham is leaving an outhouse when he is assaulted by a group of men, beaten, and urinated upon. Rackham has become an unpopular man in the community as word has gotten out that he took part in killing members of his own crew. When he returns to his brothel, Anne Bonny confronts him to see what has happened. He bemoans to her the fact that he has lost everything that he has worked so hard to build in the past few years as a respected pirate.\n\nFlint and Silver stealthily make their way through the hammocks, but must first kill a Spaniard who spots them. Once they make their way up to the top deck, they call the lookout down from his perch in the crow's nest, under the ruse that it is time for a shift change. However, as Flint kills the lookout, he realizes that the Spanish crew have awoken and that he is about to be captured.\n\nAt the Harbormaster's tent in Nassau, Low's quartermaster, Mr. Meeks, is demanding that they receive full price for the cargo they captured from the English merchantman. The Harbour Master explains to him that they are not going to receive full price for the cargo because the barrels are stained with blood. Eleanor arrives and explains to Meeks that she cannot resell the cargo in bloody barrels which means that she will incur the cost of having to repackage the goods and that she doesn't intend to suffer that financial loss.\n\nAt Rackham's bar, Eleanor has a sit down meeting with Rackham, Bonny, and Max, and wants to know why theGood Fortunewas captured by Ned Low's crew and not by Captain Hallendale and his ship, theStraight Arrow, whom she had given the lead. Max admits that she sold that lead to Low for 90 gold pieces. When Eleanor demands to know why Max would subvert her authority like that, Max fires back and states that she doesn't live her life according to what Eleanor thinks. Bonny in incensed that Max is actually such a schemer, figuring that she was just a helpless woman who needed to be saved from pirates. She tells Rackham that Max needs to be put on the streets by the next day or else she will deal with Max in her own way.\n\nBelow decks, Flint and Silver are tied to chairs as a Spanish sailor begins to interrogate them. He states that he will let one of them go with a handful of gold, but only the one who tells him what he wants to know first. Silver immediately spills all the beans about who they are and what they are attempting to do. True to his word, the Spaniard unties Silver and gives him some gold. As the Spaniard is about to shoot Flint, Silver cracks him over the head and immediately finds himself in a stand-off with the two remaining members of the Spanish crew in the room. Unfortunately, Flint only has one pistol so he must choose which Spaniard to shoot. Flint recommends that Silver kill the one with more scars as it appears that he is more battle tested. Silver agrees and shoots the scarred Spaniard and gets in a brawl with the other one. As he is about to be stabbed, Silver is saved by Flint who has managed to untie himself during the scuffle.\n\nHearing the ruckus below decks, the remainder of the Spanish crew attempts to enter the room, but Flint and Silver have successfully barricaded themselves inside. The Spanish crew is attempting to break down the door when they are surprised by theWalruscrew, who have rowed out to the Spanish ship. TheWalruscrew successfully kills the remainder of the Spanish crew and manages to lower the sails on the ship, allowing them to escape.\n\nLater that night, Max goes into Bonny's room and attempts to smooth things over. As she approaches Bonny, Bonny pulls a knife and puts it to Max's throat. However, Bonny is overcome with her hidden passion for Max and allows herself to be kissed.\n\nDown in Eleanor's bar, Eleanor pours herself a drink. She is then confronted by Low, who proceeds to tell her why he is a good captain; it is not because he is smart or a good sailor, but rather it is because he is feared and has no remorse in his heart. He then asks for proper compensation for the goods he brought in earlier. Eleanor, holding firm, then tells him to get out of her bar.\n\nIn a flashback, Flint meetsMiranda, the wife of Lord Hamilton. He introduces himself as James McGraw. Attentive viewers will notice that, despite the fact the date is given as 1705, the merchant ensign in the background of this scene features the Union Jack in its canton, rather than the historically correct Cross of St. George.\n\nLater, Dufresne informs Flint that crew has reached a vote, 17 in favour and 15 opposed, to allow Flint and Silver to escape with their lives once they reach Nassau, however, they will be kicked off the crew and will forfeit their share of any profit. When Dufresne leaves them alone, Silver tells Flint that he knows him well enough to know that he plans to become a captain again, take control of the ship, and return to the beach to steal the Spanish gold. Flint confirms that.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode begins with a man tied to a beach. CaptainHumestands over the man and tells him that he is being tortured with a technique that he learned from the Spanish wherein you expose a man to the heat while wearing a leather vest and after six days the leather vest becomes so tight that it breaks the ribs and punctures the internal organs. Hume states that he knew when he pulled the man out of the sea that he was going to be of great value to him. The man is then revealed to beBilly Bones.\n\nMeanwhile on the capturedSpanish Man O' War,Flinthas a flashback to his time in London ten years earlier where he andThomas Hamiltonare discussing how to regain control ofNassau. Expressing doubts at the prospect, Flint states that the only way to achieve success is to set up a colony there, with lawyers, carpenters, clergy, and an honest governor. Despite Flint's doubts, Hamilton still expresses optimism that with Flint's help, he can regain control of Nassau.\n\nLater, Flint andSilversit on the deck of the ship and contemplate how they are going to ingratiate themselves with the crew so they are not kicked off the crew once they return toNassau. Flint states to Silver his intentions are to be Captain once again before they reach Nassau in two days.\n\nIn Nassau,MeeksconfrontsCaptain Lowabout Low's encounter withEleanor Guthriethe night before. Meeks states that the future value they will earn if they are in Eleanor's good favour far outweighs the short-change they bore following the first encounter with Eleanor, and that Low is being unnecessarily reckless by trying to intimidate her.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau,MaxfindsAnne Bonnydrinking alone. Bonny seems to express regret about what happened the night before during her sexual encounter with Max. Max tell her that she will respect Bonny's wishes and that the previous night can be the last time. While Max is gently touching Bonny, Rackham sees their interaction from a distance.\n\nBack on the Spanish ship, Silver is brainstorming a way to get himself back in the good favor of the crew whileRandallcooks a meal.Muldoonapproaches and berates Randall for how long the food is taking to be prepared, and demands that Randall not spit in his food. When Muldoon walks away, Randall does indeed spit on Muldoon's plate.\n\nIn the captain's quarters, Flint approachesDufresnewho is sitting at the captain's table. Flint tells Dufresne a story about when Flint first found him. Flint says thatMr. Gateswas opposed to the idea of bringing someone lettered like Dufresne on board. Gates claimed that he found lettered men to be more difficult to control and harder to persuade. Flint expresses to Dufresne his regret about killing Gates. Flint states that since Gates grew fond of Dufresne that if he were to help Dufresne that it might be some small penance for what he did to Gates. Flint then offers Dufresne some advice. He advises that someone will eventually suggest to Dufresne that they tack east because that would be the fastest way home but going that route runs a greater risk of encountering a merchant ship. Dufresne asks why that would be such a bad thing. Flint then explains that the men are not ready for a real fight with the numbers they have lost and that it might lead to disaster were they to engage another ship in their condition.\n\nIn a flashback to London, Flint sits with AdmiralHennesseyand discusses Flint's appointment as Thomas Hamilton's aide. Flint notices a group of fellow officers staring at him and laughing. One of them,Pickram, approaches Flint and begins to insult Flint's appointment to Hamilton. He mockingly tells Flint of all the great benefits that may come with working for someone of Hamilton's stature, perhaps even including the benefit of sleeping with Hamilton's wife. With that, Flint assaults Pickram and engages several other men, severely beating one of them before Hennessey intervenes.\n\nBack in Nassau, Meeks sits in Eleanor's office and tells her that she has to do something to help him remove Low from his captaincy as he does not think Low has the crew's best interest at heart. Their meeting is interrupted byO'Malleywho tells her that the meeting of the consortium is ready. Eleanor tells Meeks to wait for her in the bar so they can finish the conversation later.\n\nOn the streets of Nassau,Maxis shopping when she is confronted by Rackham who demands to know what is going on between her and Bonny. Max implies that Bonny has been secretly in love with her for a while and that that is why Bonny saved Max from the tent. Rackham expresses serious doubt about that and believes that Max is simply trying to drive a wedge between he and Bonny.\n\nOn the deck of the Spanish ship, Dufresne suggests toDe Grootthat they tack east, which is exactly what Flint warned him against doing. De Groot follows his suggestion and the ship turns east. Below decks, Silver begins to speak to the crew while they are eating about the goings on with the ship. He states that a sailor which shall not be named fell asleep on his watch. As he is saying this, a sailor approaches Silver and punches him in the gut. Silver informs Flint that he is attempting to ingratiate himself with the crew by being an outlet for drama that will turn them against each other as opposed to against him.\n\nBack in Nassau, Eleanor is attending a meeting of theConsortium.Captain Lawrenceexplains to Eleanor the difficulty he had in trading during his last mission. He states that the difficulty comes from the fact that Eleanor's family name is no longer respect and is tarnished. Lawrence admits that he had to threaten the custom's man personally to get him to accept their goods and that he had to useVane'sname to complete the threat.\n\nDownstairs at Eleanor's bar, Meeks is approached by Low and Mr. Holmes. Low inquires as to the reason Meeks was seen meeting with Eleanor. Meeks responds that he has a duty to provide for the well being and safety of the crew, even if that means deposing a captain. Low and Holmes then grab Meeks, put him on a table, and decapitate him in front of the whole bar. Eleanor immediately demands that Low and his crew leave and seek like elsewhere. O'Malley then puts his sword to Low's neck and implores him to leave. Low then begins to sword fight with O'Malley, eventually gutting O'Malley and then stabbing him through the neck, killing him.\n\nBack on the Spanish ship, Silver tries again to give the \"goings-on\". Once again, he is punched by a member of the crew. Unwavering, Silver continues the \"goings-on\", stating that a member of the crew had sex with the dairy goat. When a man attempts to punch Silver yet again,Joshuaintervenes and attacks the man for having had sex with the ship's goat. Thus, Silver has finally accomplished his goal.\n\nUpon the top deck, sails are spotted in the distance. It is an English merchantman. Dufresne gives the order to attack. They approach the ship, run up their truepirate colours, and the English ship gives up without a fight. Once aboard the English ship, Dufresne and the rest of the skeleton crew are watching over the merchant crew. When the merchant captain realizes Durfresne is not Flint, the captured crew revolts and a fight ensues on board. Dufresne and the other members of the pirate crew are forced back onto their ship. Flint then begins to give commands to the crew and they follow his orders, thus seemingly completing Flint's goal of becoming captain yet again. The pirates destroy the merchant ship, leaving no survivors.\n\nLater that night, Eleanor meets with Vane. She implores him to assist her and tells him that there is a very valuable cargo on Low's ship, but she does not know what exactly.\n\nIn Rackham's bedroom, a restless Bonny leaves and goes to Max. While she and Max are passionately kissing, Rackham shows up. Rackham tells them both that he has a solution. He states that he intends to get a ship and a crew and use the leads that Max receives to enrich the three of them with equal profit of the spoils.\n\nBack on the Spanish ship, Flint has won back the captaincy in a close vote against Dufresene. Dufresne admits to Flint that he figured out that Flint had purposely put the idea into his head of tacking east into the shipping lines so that the inevitable failure would be placed upon Dufresne, thus ensuring that Flint would regain the captaincy.\n\n",

Max refuses and instead states that she will find out the information for him in exchange for him forgiving Rackham and Bonny so that they may sail again.\n\nIn Eleanor's tavern, Eleanor is in the process of hiring a new bodyguard to replaceO'Malley, who was killed by Low. She is interrupted by Flint's arrival. Eleanor gives Flint a hug, but Flint then tells her the truth of what has occurred. Flint then demands that Eleanor do something about Vane before he attempts to bring the gold back. Eleanor balks at the idea of removing Vane, claiming that Flint doesn't really understand the situation. Flint goes to Hornigold's tent and tells him that he can't figure out which side Eleanor is on. Hornigold demands that they must act quickly, regardless of whether Eleanor will condone their actions or not.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, Rackham is having problems raising a crew because no one wants to be associated with a \"crew killer\".

Jenks backs down.\n\nIn the bay, Eleanor approaches Flint's ship in a rowing boat. When she boards, she tells Flint what is occurring in the city, wherein Vane is attempting to turn the unaffiliated pirates in Nassau against Flint. When Eleanor suggests that Flint move his ship away and that he allow her, he, and Vane to have a sit down discussion, Flint completely rejects the idea and states that he is absolutely not abandoning his position where he has such a good advantage over Vane.\n\nInside the fortress, Vane enters the cell where Abigail Ashe is being held. When she asks what happened toLow, her original captor, Vane informs her that he has beheaded Low. Abigail is pleased to her that. Vane then demands that Abigal write a letter to her father, LordPeter Ashe, and ask a ransom of £250,000 in exchange for her safe return.\n\nBack aboard Flint's ship, Flint tellsSilverto go to the beach and to use his particular skill set to try and persuade the unaffiliated pirates on the beach to join his side and not Vane's.\n\nIn another flashback to London, Hamilton proposes a new plan to Flint about how to solve the Nassau pirate problem. Hamilton proposes that they don't execute any pirates but that they instead offer the pirates a pardon. He claims that the island needs farmers and merchant and others who are invested in the island's future and he thinks that pardoned pirates might fit that description. Flint is adamantly opposed, stating that \"to pardon a traitor is the act of a coward.\" He suggests that Hamilton forget he even thought of it.\n\nOn the beach at Nassau, a man is telling terrible stories to other pirates about the atrocities that Vane and his crew committed when they first captured the fortress. It is later revealed that this man was paid by Silver. Later, a man spots Silver as being a member of the Walrus crew. He tells Silver that another Walrus man has washed up on shore. When Silver goes to see this man who washed ashore, it isBilly Bones.\n\nIn an attempt to get Flint to ease his position, Eleanor goes to visitMrs. Barlow. Barlow says she will not speak to Flint. When Eleanor questions whether Barlow really cares about Flint, Barlow demands that she Eleanor leave.\n\nIn Rackham's brothel, Max lays out a plan to try and gain Rackham more crew members. Max takes him to Idelle, who states that she knows an influential pirate namedFeatherstone. Idelle tells Rackham that Featherstone has the trust of a large group of pirates who are currently conflicted about whether to support Vane or Flint. Rackham and Max feel that Featherstone and his men can be swayed to join Rackham's crew. When Idelle suggests that can accomplish this through purely erotic methods, Max instead recommends that Idelle seduce him and make him fall in love with her. Idelle tells Max that she completely understands this and will attempt it soon. Later that night, Max announces to Rackham that Featherstone has indeed been swayed by Idelle to join Rackham, along with 28 other men and their ship.\n\nOn the outskirts of town, Silver has Bones hid up inside of a hut.RandalltellsSilverthat they are doing wrong by hiding him there. When Bones awakens and sees Silver, the first thing he does is to ask for Mr. Gates.\n\nBack aboard Flint's ship, Hornigold is expressing his logistical concerns about the coming attack in regards to the number of men that each side has to fight against each other. Flint then flashes back to a dinner in London between he, Thomas Hamilton, Lord Hamilton, and Mrs. Barlow. When Lord Hamilton asks about Thomas' plan about what to do about the pirates of Nassau, Thomas presents his position concerning the pardons. Lord Hamilton, as expected, finds this idea completely preposterous and demands to know how Thomas attempts to accomplish this. Thomas states that he can get enough votes in parliament to achieve a blanket amnesty act. When Lord Hamilton asks Flint his opinion on the matter, Barlow chimes in and is interrupted by Lord Hamilton who states that she has done enough to damage the family name and that he suggests that she keep both her mouth and her legs shut. Flint answers Lord Hamilton that he does indeed support the amnesty plan and also requests that Lord Hamilton leave the house at once.\n\nAt Mrs. Barlow's house,Pastor Lambrickcomes to her door in the early morning. Lambrick tells Barlow of what is happening in Nassau, including the fact that one pirate crew has the daughter of the governor of the Carolina colony held captive for ransom. Barlow then suddenly remembers the girl and remembers that her name is Abigail. Barlow then flashes back to London, where Thomas Hamilton is laying out his amnesty plan to a group of parliament members and their wives. When he asks which of them will help him, the only who stays and offers help is Lord Peter Ashe.\n\nDrinking alone in her room, Eleanor hears a commotion downstairs. When she goes to investigate what is occurring, she sees that her father,Richard Guthrie, has come to town to help her.\n\nBefore dawn,Mr. Scottand Flint are talking aboard Flint's ship. Flint asks Scott his advice. Scott tells him that there must be another way other than open war among the pirates. Scott advices that if the pirates are divided, then they can easily lose Nassau to either the British or the Spanish. Below decks, the men are poised to launch their attack against the fortress. Flint tells them to open fire.\n\n",

They are interrupted by the guns ofFlint'sship firing on the fortress.\n\nOutsideMiranda Barlow'shouse, she is climbing atop a carriage in an attempt to find Flint and get him to stop the bombardment. She flashes back to her time in London ten years earlier.Peter AsheandThomas Hamiltonare arguing about the pardons that Hamilton wishes to put in place in Nassau. Ashe claims there is no way that he can get the act passed in Parliament.\n\nBack in Nassau,John Silveris discussingGates'death withBilly Bones. He claims to have seen the absolute heartache in Flint's eyes after the deed was done. Silver continues to try to convince Bones that Flint is doing the right thing. When Bones demands that he is going to go see the crew right away, he realizes that Silver has locked him up inside the hut.\n\nIn another flashback to London, Flint has arrived from a lengthy visit to Nassau to personally inspect the situation. Flint tells Hamilton and Ashe that the governor of the Nassau colony has had his wife and small child murdered by pirates. This infinitely complicates any attempt to get the Nassau pirates a pardon.\n\nIn Nassau, Rackham is looking at designs for his flag that is being drawn up by a prostitute namedCharlotte. He doesn't like any of her designs, much to her dismay. He demands that they have to get the flag just right. His new crew mate Featherstone claims he has never sailed with anyone as particular as Rackham. Featherstone then tries to discuss the articles of incorporation for the new crew, but abruptly stops when Bonny comes to sit down. She brings up what she saw earlier in the day between Rackham and Max and claims that she has no right to be upset and that they'll get through it.\n\nAboard Flint's ship, his gun crews continue to pound the fortress, taking huge chunks of wall out of it. Flint calls for a cease fire and commands that the men prepare to move ashore to storm the fortress. Inside the fortress, Vane and his men are hunkered safely below ground.Jenksdelivers the grim news of the casualties and the damage to the fortress toVane. Vane then asks thatAbigail Ashebe taken back to her cell. He then declares that he is leaving the fortress. When Jenks asks him why he is leaving, Vane responds that he must cut off the head of the invading force.\n\nAtEleanor'sbar, she and her fatherRichard Guthrieare discussing her future. Guthrie tells Eleanor thatUnderhillis not completely against working with her and her consortium, but that they must ship goods that are legally obtained. She demands that she will not work with her father again until she can totally trust him.\n\nWhen Flint andHornigoldare coming ashore in preparation for the attack, Flint encounters Mrs. Barlow who wants to speak to him at once, claiming that she can save his life.\n\nFlashing back to London, Flint and AdmiralHennesseyare walking through theAdmiraltywhile Flint is trying to convince Hennessey of his plan. Hennessey then opens a door and walks into a room withAlfred Hamiltonwaiting for them. Hennessey then declares that Hamilton has informed him all about what Flint has been doing with the Hamiltons and that he is being discharged from the Navy for it and should be lucky that the penalty is not more severe. He demands that Flint then leave London immediately. When Flint goes to Thomas Hamilton's house, Ashe explains that Thomas has been taken to a mental hospital, all of his possessions are to be confiscated by his father, and that Mrs. Hamilton must disappear at once.\n\nBack in Nassau, preparations for the attack are being made by the men on the beach. Rackham asks Max if any of her workers have had any of Flint's crew as customers since Flint has returned. Charlotte has indeed been with one of Flint's men, but not recently. Rackham wants her to find out from him anything she can about the Urca gold. Rackham andFeatherstonethen have a discussion about the articles being created. Featherstone tells him that he has a problem with both Max and Bonny receiving such a significant share of any future profits. Later, Rackham goes and finds Bonny. He tells her that she must stay ashore and not be a part of the crew for awhile until Rackham can gain the trust of the crew. Upon hearing this, Bonny storms off.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, Silver and Bones are still discussing what has been going on since Bones fell into the sea. Silver says he will let him go so long as he knows what Bones will tell the crew about what happened the night Bones fell in the ocean. Bones responds that Silver should be more concerned about the thing that pulled him out of the water, not the thing that put him in the war. Silver then gives him the key and releases Bones.\n\nIn the parlor of Eleanor's tavern, Flint and Barlow begin to discuss what has occurred in the town since Flint has been gone. She informs Flint that Vane has captured Abigail Ashe and that Flint needs to take her from Vane and then return her safely to Ashe. She believes that Ashe would help Flint in his efforts to reform Nassau. Flint finds the proposition to be extremely unlikely because Ashe has changed since they knew him last and that he is now violent toward pirates.\n\nIn a flashback to London, Hamilton puts his arms around Flint and then the two kiss. Flint then remembers all of the intimate moments that he and Hamilton had shared together. Back in Nassau, Flint is still remembering when suddenly Vane springs from somewhere in the room and attacks Flint.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens with CaptainsFlintandVanewrestling in aEleanor'sempty tavern. The two men trade blows with each other until they are interrupted by Eleanor Guthrie who fires a shot from a musket in their direction. The two men immediately stop fighting. Flint then tells Vane that he will stand his men down from attacking Vane's fortress if Vane will giveAbigail Asheto him. Flint then asks that Eleanor go and bring her father,Richard Guthrie, to a meeting at the tavern.\n\nOut at sea,Rackhamis enjoying being back out on the water aboard his new ship theColonial Dawn. Following a lead from Max, Rackham's crew is looking for a ship called theTrue North, which is soon spotted right where it was supposed to be. However, another set of sails is spotted in the distance. Apparently another pirate ship is chasing theTrue North.\n\nOn the beach at Nassau, Flint's crew is waiting for Flint's orders.Logancan't take the boredom and decides to go see his favorite whore,Charlotte, despite the fact that Flint demanded that no one go see the whores for fear that they will let slip critical information about their hunt for the Urca gold. Soon after Logan leaves to see Charlotte,Billy Bonesenters the camp. This is the first time that the majority of the crew know that Bones has survived his fall into the sea. They are elated to see him andDufresnegives him a hug.\n\nIn Eleanor's tavern, Richard Guthrie appears along withMiranda Barlowand Flint begins to outlay his plan. He tells everyone that England is soon going to assault Nassau in an attempt to exterminate the pirates on the island. Flint states that there is a way that their downfall can be avoided and that Abigail Ashe is the key. Flint believes that if he returns Abigail toPeter Ashe, that Ashe will be more likely to promote the idea of providing pardons to all the pirates of Nassau. Vane demands that he will only hand Abigail over to Flint if he is given the Spanish Man of War. Flint states that he absolutely will not do this and Vane leaves the meeting. Later, Eleanor guarantees to Flint that everything will work out and that Vane will agree to the terms.\n\nIn Rackham's brothel,Maxis going over the leads that are being supplied to her by the whores whenIdellewalks in and tells Max about whatAnne Bonnyhas been up to. Apparently after not being allowed to serve on Rackham's ship, Bonny tried to join another crew. When she was rejected by that crew, Bonny grabbed a marling spike and punched it in the man's jaw, causing him to lose several teeth. Idelle then asks why Max hasn't put men at her door, fearing that Bonny will soon take out her wrath upon Max herself. Max explains that Bonny would never harm her and that she has no fear for her safety and will not give the illusion to Bonny that she has something to fear from her, thus making herself seem like another enemy of Bonny's.\n\nBack at sea, Rackham's crew has successfully captured theTrue North, but the other pirate ship has pulled up alongside and her crew boards theTrue North. The captain of the ship introduces himself to Rackham. His name isLinus Harcourtand his ship is named theGoliath. Harcourt explains to Rackham that one of three things is about to occur. First, the two crews can fight it out. Second, the two captains can fight it out. Third, the two captains can negotiate a reasonable split of the prize.\n\nBack on the beach at Nassau, Bones is telling the crew about how his story. He claims that when he fell in the water, he was rescued by theHMSScarboroughand that there is a large British camp set up not 40 miles away. Dufresne interrupts him and states that what the crew really wants to know is how he fell in the water, not particularly how he got out. Dufresne tells Bones that they all believe that Bones was pushed into the water by Flint to silence his opposition to Flint.\n\nIn Rackham's brothel, Bonny is drinking when she spiesCharlottecoming down the stairs in a hurry. Bonny stops Charlotte and tells her that she knows that one of Flint's crew is up there. She then threatens Charlotte and demands to know what valuable information was told to her. Charlotte tells her that theUrcagold is on the beach and that Flint still plans to go get it. Bonny then storms up to Charlotte's room where Logan is dressing and puts a knife to his throat and demands to know where the gold is. Logan, sure that Bonny won't harm him because he is one of Flint's men, insults her. Bonny then cuts his throat and then immediately stabs Charlotte to death.\n\nAboard theTrue North, Captain Harcourt and Rackham are trying to come to reasonable terms to split the ship. However, the terms that Harcourt comes up with give his crew 9/10ths of the profit. Rackham states that it is nowhere near a reasonable deal.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, Silver tells Flint that Bones has told the crew that he fell into the water and that Flint had actually tried to save him. Flint then enters the tent where Bones is and gives him a hug, telling him that he is glad to have him back. Hornigold interrupts the reunion and tells Flint that his men are growing impatient and that he demands to know what Flint is going to do to win back Hornigold's fort from Vane. Flint then tells Hornigold and Dufresne his plan which would allow Vane to keep the fortress. Hornigold is furious that Flint has cast aside their arrangement to return the fort to Hornigold. He tells Dufresne to prepare the men for a vote and tells Flint that he intends to be placed in charge of both crews so he can lead the assault on the fort.\n\nBack at the brothel, Idelle shows Max the room where Logan and Charlotte lay dead. She sees Bonny in the corner, still holding her bloody blade. Max tells Bonny that there may be serious consequences to what Bonny has done to Logan, but that Max will stand in between those consequences and Bonny and will protect her.\n\nIn the fortress, Eleanor approaches Vane and tells him that she knows that she has put him in a weakened position and that it is difficult for someone with Vane's pride to accept, but that they still control such a valuable asset: legitimacy. She tells him that once England ratifies their legitimacy that they will make more money than they ever had before through legitimate business. She asks that he give up the girl and that he therefore give them the chance to have a future together, free from piracy. Vane rejects this and tells Eleanor that she should never weaken her position and allow Flint to take from them what is already theirs. Eleanor appears moved by this and begins to passionately kiss Vane.\n\nBack aboard theTrue North, Rackham is showing his quartermaster, Mr.Featherstone, the terms that Harcourt gave them. Featherstone agrees that it is nowhere near an even split, but that they should take the deal anyways, feeling that they have no other choice because they are so outnumbered by theGoliath'screw. Rackham realizes that if he were to accept such paltry terms, his men might be happy that they've escaped with their lives, but that he would be voted out of the captaincy before they returned to Nassau. Rackham then sits back down with Harcourt. Suddenly he throws hiswinein Harcourt's face and slashes him across the neck with his sword. Harcourt then begins to savagely beat Rackham, clearly a man with more fighting experience. However, as he leans over Rackham preparing to strike again, the wound in his neck opens up and begins to gush blood. Harcourt soon falls on top of Rackham and dies. Rackham immediately jumps up and implores both crews to hold their fire. He lies and tells them that Harcourt refused to come up with any terms that would have allowed the crew of theTrue Northto survive and that that was a condition that he simply could not abide by and that's why he fought Harcourt. He then orders his crew to cut the captured crew loose. TheTrue Northcrew are then given guns which doubles Rackham's crew, giving him now the advantage over theGoliath'screw. He asks the crew of theGoliathif there are any among them who would volunteer to come forward and reach reasonable terms with him and one man does.\n\nBack in Nassau, Bones is speaking privately with Dufresne. He admits that he didn't escape from the British crew, but that he was released by Captain Hume for a reason. He states that Hume offered him and nine men of his choosing full pardons if they would capture Flint and bring him to Hume at Harbour Island. Elsewhere, Silver approaches Flint who is sitting alone reading a book. He tells Flint that the vote is in Flint's favor by a half dozen votes. Flint believes that he needs to win by a margin of twenty to keep Hornigold from moving on the fort. Silver then tells him that there is one particular vote that he is having trouble with: his own. He asks Flint about Flint's commitment to retrieving theUrcagold. Flint responds that the gold is his top priority, nothing else. That settles it for Silver.\n\nWhen Silver leaves Flint, he is intercepted by Muldoon who tells Silver that Logan has gone missing and can likely be found at the brothel. At the brothel, he finds Max who then takes him to the room where Logan still lays dead. Silver then comes up with an idea that may work to keep the crew from finding out about Logan's death. He creates a fiction where Logan and his lover have run off together to Providence, which he will tell the crew. He then demands that Max take care of the mess immediately before anyone else sees it.\n\nAt the fort, Eleanor quietly takes the keys from Vane as he is sleeping. She goes to the cell where Abigail is kept and tells her that she is no longer a hostage.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens deep within the fortress in Abigail Ashe's cell. She is telling Eleanor Guthrie about how she remembers Hamilton's wife, Miranda Barlow. Eleanor explains the situation of Vane and Flint to Abigail but she is afraid of Captain Flint, having heard many horrible tales about him from her father. Eleanor finally gets Abigail to agree to flee with her by asking her to trust \"Lady Hamilton's\" judgement about Captain Flint.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, the men are beginning to gather for the vote between Flint and Hornigold. Billy Bones approaches Flint and tells Flint that he is up in the vote count, but Flint is still nervous, knowing that men can switch their votes on a whim. When the meeting starts, Hornigold begins his speech, using the tactic that the men should never trust someone like Flint who has backstabbed men multiple times just in recent weeks. While Hornigold continues his speech, John Silver approaches and tells Flint thatVincentandNicholashave returned from their mission in which they were to keep an eye on theUrcagold. They inform Flint that the gold is all gone, that two Spanish ships arrived and took every piece of gold off the beach. The men overhear this and begin to spread the word.\n\nAt Rackham's brothel, Max has aservantburn all of Anne Bonny's clothes, except for herhat. Max informs Bonny that all evidence of Bonny's crime has been cleaned up. She gives Bonny a fresh dress and shoes to wear for when she feels like getting out of bed. Bonny then opens up and tells Max about her marriage to a man when she was only thirteen. The man abused her and burned her and passed her around among his crew. She states that one day she was in a tavern and her husband was abusing her. During the abuse, a man walked over and cut her husband's throat; this man wasJack Rackham. She expresses sorrow for the fact that she is not the person she was supposed to be when she was born in that she has been warped and manipulated by multiple barbarous men that she has become one herself. Outside,Idelletells Max that she and the girls have been talking and that they want to get some men to the brothel to protect Max. Max begs Idelle to not bring any more attention to Bonny and demands that the brothel be a safe place for Bonny. Idelle agrees to this request.\n\nBack outside,Dufresneis explaining to Flint and Silver that Hornigold's faction has completely faded away and that the men are now concerned about what their next move is going to be since the gold has disappeared. Flint declares to Silver that they must now find a way to convince the men to continue to go along with the plan to return Abigail to her father. Silver stops Flint in his tracks and states that they quit being a team once the gold disappeared. Flint then convinces Silver to go speak to the men on his behalf by appealing to Silver's vanity. He tells Silver that there is no other place in the world where Silver matters other than with the crew of his ship. Silver then gives a speech to the men in which he tells them the value of Flint's plan. He tells them that by following Flint, they have the chance to one day live their lives not as wanted men, but as free men.\n\nClose by, Dufresne and Bones are watching Silver give his speech. They begin to discuss Flint's plan. Dufresne thinks it is madness because he feels there is no way that Peter Ashe, the most dogged pirate hunter in the New World, would ever give pardons to pirates. Dufresne tells Bones that they both know what needs to be done: capturing Flint and giving him to the Navy in exchange for pardons for them and eight other men. Bones then tells him to go find eight men who would be willing to betray Flint and to meet up in an hour. Later, when Dufresne has gathered the men together, he meets up with Bones. However, Bones is not alone. He arrives with the rest of the crew who have all remained loyal to Flint. Bones tells Dufresne that there will be no more dissent and no more interference with Flint's plans and demands that Dufresne and the others leave.\n\nBack at the brothel, Bonny has put on the dress Max gave her. She heads downstairs where she is given some soup by Max. As she is eating, a sailor namedJacob Garrettapproaches and begins to flirt with Bonny. For some reason, Bonny takes him upstairs as if she were a prostitute. Before anything can happen, Idelle intervenes and distracts the man, giving Bonny an avenue to leave the room. Standing outside the room she begins to cry. Max soon appears and comforts her with an embrace.\n\nIn the fortress, Eleanor and Abigail are wandering deep through the lower corridors, looking for the exit. They finally find a gate leading to the outside. However, when Eleanor unlocks it, she is unable to get it open. Finally, after considerable effort, she is able to get herself and Abigail through the gate. But as she is locking the gate, Vane appears. He tells Eleanor that he killed Low's crew for her. He tells Eleanor if she takes Abigail, his men will turn on him and kill him. Finally, he tells her if she walks away with the girl, she will surely hear from him again. Despite Vane's pleas, Eleanor locks the gate and walks away with Abigail.\n\nIn Eleanor's tavern, Richard Guthrie and Barlow are awaiting the arrival of Eleanor with Abigail. Soon, Eleanor and Abigail appears. Abigail recognizes Barlow and hugs her. When Eleanor heads upstairs, Richard Guthrie approaches and embraces his daughter, who returns the embrace.\n\nOn the beach, Flint is approached by Bones who tells him that they've lost about eighteen defectors in the past hour. Nevertheless, most of the men remain with Flint. Flint asks Bones why he is supporting his captaincy. Bones tells him that when he fell into the sea, he remembers slipping on the bow and remembers reaching out and grabbing Flint's hand. The last thing he remembers before going into the water is Flint's hand slipping away. He states that he doesn't know whether Flint intentionally dropped him or not and states that he doesn't really care. He believes that he needs to remain loyal to Flint because the last man who crossed him, Mr. Gates, wound up being killed by Flint.\n\nFlint is then summoned to the tavern where he introduces himself to Abigail. He tells her his name is James McGraw and that he is friends with her family.\n\nElsewhere, Dufresne approaches Hornigold, who is saddling his horse preparing to leave. Hornigold tells Dufresne that he is finally leaving the island. He states that he knows he doesn't have many years left but that he doesn't want to spend his final years swallowed up there. Dufresne then states that there is a way for Hornigold to restore his name and live out his days as a free man.\n\nIn the brothel, Max is enjoying a drink alone when Silver interrupts her. He tells Max that they must discuss something. Silver admits to Max that when the two scouts arrived on the beach, they told him that the gold was actually still there and that what had occurred was that the Spanish sailors on the beach had all become ill and died, leaving the gold virtually defenseless. He then asks Max if she knows of a crew who would be willing to go there and collect the gold.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, Richard Guthrie is riding in a carriage when they stop on a misty road. Guthrie gets out and with a lantern walks into the fog. Standing before him is a group of men, barely visible.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens withAbigail Ashehiding below deck of theGood Fortuneas Ned Low's men are boarding. She is huddled under the stairs with Miranda, who whispers, \"It's all right, you're all right, I'm here.\"\n\nSeconds later, Low's men pull Miranda away screaming, as Low discovers Abigail.\n\nAbigail awakes from her nightmare to Miranda's comforting touch, whispering the same words of comfort as she did in Abigail's dream.\n\nShe is currently aboard Flint's ship on her way back to Charles Town to the safety of her father,Lord Peter Ashe. She writes in her journal about how her preconceived notions about pirates have begun to change. Flint and Mrs. Barlow begin to discuss how well Abigail seems to be taking everything, and reminisce about the last time they saw her, when she was just five, hiding behind her mother's dress.\n\nBack in Nassau,Featherstonearrives, somewhat vexed, at Rackham's brothel. He is upset that he must lie to his men about why they are clearing everything out of the hull of theColonial Dawn. Rackham reminds him that he must keep it a secret if they are to ever achieve the goal of taking theUrcagold. Once Featherstone leaves, Max reveals thatAnne Bonnyhas left Nassau. Rackham is clearly distraught over her departure.\n\nDownstairs in the brothel, a young prostitute observes Featherstone arguing withIdelle. She leaves the brothel and goes to a house whereMrs. Mapletonhas resided since being dismissed by Rackham. She tells Mapleton about what is going on at the brothel, with Featherstone having secret meetings with Max and Rackham. Mapleton pays her extra for her silence before sending her away.\n\nMapleton then meets with Eleanor Guthrie, revealing that she has been hired by Eleanor to keep an eye on what Max is doing in the brothel. She tells Eleanor thatCharlottehas disappeared, allegedly fleeing with Logan away from Nassau. Mapleton knows this cannot be true, as Charlotte entrusted Mapleton with her savings, which she still possesses. She tells Eleanor that she believes Max and Rackham are conspiring to send theColonial Dawnto retrieve the gold whilst Flint is taking Abigail back toCharles Town.\n\nAboard Flint's ship, John Silver is giving the \"goings-on\" to the crew. He begins to tell a story about the horrors that he had seen when he had last visitedCharles Town. He tells them about the gunboats that patrol the harbour and about an execution he witnessed of a pirate.Mr. ScottandBilly Bonesare observing this when Bones reveals to Scott that Silver is just retelling a story from another pirate, surmising that it would be unwise to believe anything that Silver says. As Silver is finishing his story, he seesNicholassnickering in the back of the crowd. Following his speech, Silver confronts Nicholas andVincentbelow decks, demanding that they shut their mouths and not do anything that might give their scheme away. When Nicholas walks away, Silver tells Vincent that Nicholas has the potential to be a serious problem for them both.\n\nElsewhere on the ship, Billy Bones tells Flint thatDe Grootthinks they can gain some speed by adjusting the sails, but since this is to be done at night, it is riskier than usual. Flint tells him to go ahead and do it. As Bones leaves, Abigail asks about him, since his demeanor is not like the other pirates on the crew. Flint tells Abigail that Bones's parents were Levellers from Kensington who spoke out about the impressment of men and boys into the Navy. One day, Bones had been handing out pamphlets supporting the abolition of impressment when he was, somewhat ironically, taken by a press gang. When he was rescued by Flint many years later, Bones killed the man who had captured him. However, he refused to go home because he did not think his father would approve of his becoming a murderer.\n\nOn the top deck, De Groot orders Nicholas to go up the main mast and release the sails. As he is up there, Vincent and Silver are below decks and Vincent reveals that he has taken care of the problem with Nicholas. He reveals that he has sabotaged the footing rope on the main mast, knowing that Nicholas was going to go up there, thus leading to Nicholas falling to his death. Silver is aghast and runs to the top deck just in time to see Nicholas fall and die.\n\nBack in Nassau, Featherstone, Rackham, and Max are trying to figure out what they are going to do once they actually get the gold back to Nassau. They are brainstorming where they are going to hide it. The best Featherstone can do is suggest that they bury it in a hole. Rackham then comes up with the idea of storing the gold in thefortress.\n\nIn Eleanor's tavern,Frasierapproaches Eleanor and tells her that theColonial Dawnis most certainly emptying her hold, giving further credence to the theory Mrs. Mapleton had proposed. Frasier tells Eleanor about the damage that could be done were the gold ever to reach the shores of Nassau. He states that pirates with that much gold will only be more empowered than ever and that it would surely kill any hopes of reconciliation with England. Eleanor tells him that the only way to actually stop the plan is to have everyone killed, including Max and Rackham. She declares that is something that she absolutely will not do.\n\nBack on Flint's ship, the men are sewing Nicholas into his burial bag. Silver confronts Vincent about his decision to murder Nicholas. Vincent tells Silver that earlier in the day Silver gave him a look that indicated that they should dispose of the problem. Silver denies ever giving such a look to Vincent. Later, the men above decks bury Nicholas at sea.\n\nSoon, Flint's ship arrives in Charles Town harbour. Below decks, Abigail speaks to Flint and Barlow. She tells them the reason why her father had changed from a reasonable man to such a hater of pirates. She states that it was the murder ofAlfred Hamiltonaboard theMaria Aleyneby Flint and his men that changed his view and that from then on he would dedicate his life to eradicating piracy from the New World. In light of this, Abigail requests that as soon as she is returned that Flint should turn around and sail away.\n\nUp on the top deck, Flint tells Bones and Scott that he wants them to stay out of range of the patrol boats in the harbour. If they stay out of range it is a sign that they mean no harm. He also tells them that he does not want a single gun port to be opened, and no men are to carry weapons on deck. Flint then tells Barlow that he wishes her to stay aboard because he fears that Ashe will see her as someone who is aiding a pirate and hang her as well as him. Barlow then tells Flint that she is the reason Alfred Hamilton was killed because she is the one who uncovered that he was going to be a passenger on that ship. So she feels that she is as culpable of that sin as Flint is. Flint reconsiders and allows her to join him in going ashore.\n\nA man approaches in a small boat from the shore asking for Captain Vane. Flint responds that he is not Vane and that he has no demands, but that he is a request to see Peter Ashe. When he is rowed to shore, he is met by one of Ashe's subordinates,William Rhett. As Rhett is walking Flint and Barlow through the town, Flint is suddenly set upon by men who repeatedly kick him. Abigail intervenes and demands that they stop, explaining that Flint is an old friend of her father's. Once inside the governor's mansion, Abigail is reunited with her father. When Ashe walks into the room and stands in front of Flint and Mrs. Barlow, there is silence as he looks Flint in the eye. After a few moments a look of recognition comes across all their faces and Lord Ashe states: \"welcome toCharles Town.\"\n\nBack in Nassau, Rackham and Featherstone stand outside the fortress knocking on the door. They hear no noise and can see vultures flying over head. When it becomes apparent that no one is inside, Rackham and his men batter the wall down. Inside they find the fort abandoned, save for the crucified corpse ofRichard Guthrie. When Eleanor arrives to see the body, she is given a note fromCharles Vanewhich was pinned to her father's corpse. The note states that Vane is no longer a slave but is a free man and that he wishes Nassau to remain free. He writes that Richard Guthrie was engaged in an effort to return Nassau to the King of England and that he therefore deserved to die a traitors death.\n\nHe says he was warned about Eleanor betraying him but had hoped they shared enough history for that not to happen. He further states that he will be tracking Flint's ship toCharles Town. While Flint's attention is elsewhere, he plans to take the Spanish Man O War because that is the price he asked to give up Abigail to Flint, but Eleanor stole the girl and he was never compensated. The episode ends with Vane and his crew lying in wait near the Spanish Man O War in the shallow marshes outsideCharles Town.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens with the body ofRichard Guthriebeing prepared for burial asEleanorwatches. Later, she sits in her office greeting individual mourners lined up outside her tavern desiring to pay their respects to her father. One of the mourners isMax, who brings bread and fruit from the girls at Rackham's brothel. Eleanor explains to Max there is now a war between her andCharles Vane, concerning the future of the island and everyone must now choose sides.\n\nMax exits her meeting with Eleanor and encountersJack Rackhamon the street outside of Eleanor's tavern. Max feels Eleanor is up to something and wishes Rackham to launch his ship as soon as possible in order to retrieve theUrcagold. As they are speaking, Max notices Eleanor is watching them from her window. Inside the tavern,Frasierannounces to Eleanor the arrival of two mysterious men.\n\nInCharles Town,Captain FlintandMiranda Barloware meeting withPeter Ashediscussing Flint's proposal to move forward with his plans for reconciliation between England and the pirates ofNassau. Ashe makes it clear the only reason they are sitting down together is because Flint brought Abigail back unharmed. He then says although they knew each other in the past, he does not recognize the two people that sit before him. Flint encourages him to ask any questions and promises he will be truthful in answering. When the subject ofAlfred Hamiltonis brought up, Miranda admits she is the one who arranged his execution. Flint then asks that Ashe not judge him for his past deeds and instead offer him redemption. Flint then outlines his plan, stating most of the pirates will agree to stop pirating and work legally as merchant sailors. Ashe eventually agrees to consider the plan. As they are talking, Miranda's attention is diverted to the chiming of a grandfather clock.\n\nIn the harbor at Charles Town,Billy Bonesasks for volunteers among the riggers to repair the top sail footrope that killedNicholas. When no one volunteers, Bones goes up the rigging to repair the footrope himself. AsJohn SilverandVincentlook on, Silver asks Vincent if there is any way that Bones will discover Vincent's sabotage of the rope. Vincent tells him that it is unlikely. Elsewhere on the ship,DooleytellsMr. Scotthe thinks he sees something moving out in the marsh. Scott tells him to keep an eye on it.\n\nIn Nassau, the funeral for Richard Guthrie is underway. Following the burial, Eleanor encounters Mr. Underhill and asks for an audience with him.\n\nBack on Flint's ship, Bones continues working in the rigging during the night. As Silver is walking below decks, he encounters Randall, who has been stabbed and killed. Up in the rigging, Billy looks down and sees that the ship is being boarded by Vane's men. During the attack,Joshuaand many other crew members are killed. Vane and Bones square off in a prolonged sword fight, which results in Bones' being captured when some of Vane's men arrive. Among those alive but captured areDe Groot,Joji,DooleyandMuldoon.\n\nIn Charles Town, Flint and Miranda are preparing for dinner. Flint tells Miranda about where the nameFlintcame from. He states that when his grandfather was a young man, he worked as a deckhand on a privateer off the coast of Massachusetts. One night while he was on watch, a man climbed aboard his ship and stated that his name was Mr. Flint. The man then said that he had fled from another ship because he was accused of killing another man. He never stated whether he was innocent of the crime or not. He asked for some rum and then disappeared, never to be seen again. Flint tells Miranda he likes the idea of discarding his persona and says he is ready to retire Captain Flint back to the sea.\n\nBack aboard Flint's ship, Silver and Vincent continue to hide below decks. Silver tells Vincent that they are in a tight spot, either be killed by Vane's crew or swim to the beach and risk being hanged as pirates.\n\nIn Miranda Barlow's house, Eleanor and Mr. Underhill are discussing Eleanor and Flint's plan to restore Nassau to English control. She explains that she will be the end of piracy on the island. She then tells Underhill about the plan that is already underway to take out Rackham's crew before they are able to set sail and secure theUrcagold. She is using the mysterious men from before to stealthily kill Rackham's crew.\n\nIn Rackham's tent,Anne Bonnyappears, having been away for some time. Rackham is overjoyed to see her, stating that he truly never thought he was going to see her again. Bonny states that she thought about leaving for good but before she can say why she returned, Eleanor's men enter the tent and attackFeatherstoneand then Rackham. Bonny quickly disposes of both the men, killing them. They seek refuge in the brothel. Max states that they must leave immediately. Along with Anne, Featherstone and Rackham go to their ship to begin the voyage.\n\nOn Flint's ship, Silver tells Vincent that he has a plan to delay Vane from leaving the harbor with the ship. Silver plans to sabotage the ship by cutting the fore-stay, which holds the fore-mast in place. With the fore-stay severed, the fore-mast would likely snap completely if the ship were to sail. Silver knows that Vane would then have to spend a good deal of time continuing to sit in the harbor to repair the damage. Silver climbs out onto the bowsprit and attempts to sever the fore-stay.\n\nIn the captain's cabin, Vane approaches Bones and confesses that when he and Rackham backedSingletonto depose Flint, it was mainly done to try and steal away certain crew members of theWalrus, including Bones, whom Vane greatly admires for his courage and loyalty. Bones explains to Vane why they are in Charles Town. He states that they are there trying to gain forgiveness from England because the Royal Navy is about to take Nassau back and reconciliation is the only way for all of them to survive. Suddenly, Silver succeeds in cutting the fore-stay and the whole ship lurches from the damage. Knowing there are saboteurs onboard, Vane goes below decks to neutralize the threat.\n\nIn Charles Town, Flint, Miranda, and Ashe are having dinner. Ashe states that he has given it much thought and the only way for Flint's plan to work is that they both return to London together where Flint will confess his crimes and ask forgiveness from Parliament. He states that Flint must tell the whole truth including the relationship with Thomas Hamilton. Ashe believes that this will work because Parliament will see that the most feared pirate in the New World is not a monster, but a very flawed man. Flint agrees. Just then, Miranda realizes why the clock is so familiar to her: it belonged to Thomas and was in their home in London. Ashe admits that it was a gift from Alfred Hamilton. It is then revealed that Ashe was the reason behind all of their misfortune. Miranda realizes that James McGraw was well liked and had a good reputation among the Navy and that there must have been another reason why everyone believed the affair between him and Hamilton was true. She stands to confront Ashe with the accusations and states that he sold them out to become governor of the Carolina colony. Ashe says that he was forced to betray them because Lord Hamilton was threatening his family. Miranda becomes increasingly aggravated and says she would like Ashe to take responsibility for ruining her life and that he should be swinging from the end of a rope. Suddenly, she is shot through the head and killed byColonel Rhett. Flint then attacks Rhett but is subdued and knocked out by Ashe's men.\n\nAboard Flint's ship, Vane is searching for the saboteur below decks when he spots Silver. As he approaches Silver he is taken from behind by Vincent who puts a knife at his neck. Outside the ship, a launch approaches from shore. The men on the launch announce a message from Ashe. An agreement with Flint could not be met and he is now considered a threat to Charles Town and has been taken into custody. There will be a swift trial for Captain Flint the next day and if their ship is still in the harbor, they will seize or sink it. Vane then quickly disarms Vincent and Silver, taking them both prisoner. Vane, Silver and Vincent then come out on the deck and Vane proposes to Bones they attack the city and free Flint because if one of the most feared pirate captains in Nassau is hung then nobody will ever fear the pirates of Nassau again.\n\nIn Mrs. Barlow's house, Eleanor is concluding her business with Underhill when she is confronted outside byBenjamin HornigoldandDufresnewho take her prisoner. They deliver her to CaptainHumeand request the ten pardons that Hume promised to Bones if Bones were to deliver Flint. Hornigold tells Hume what a terrific prize Eleanor will make when he takes her back to London, as she is responsible for brokering all the illegal pirate trade in Nassau. Hume throws the pardons on the beach for Hornigold and the men and takes Eleanor captive.\n\n",

Vane tells Jenks that he is taking half of his crew with him for the rescue attempt and that Jenks is to wait on board with the other half until his return. Jenks feels that the men remaining on board may wish to just take the prize back to Nassau and leave Vane behind in Charles Town.\n\nElsewhere on the ship,John SilverandBilly Bonesare in chains along with the rest of Flint's crew. Vane approaches Bones and explains his plan to him and asks for Bones's help in restraining Flint's men from any foolish actions such as a revolt that would only result in bloodshed on both sides.

She tells him that they will be together until they are both dead.\n\nBack aboard Flint's ship, Jenks and Yardley are discussing their odds of successfully escaping the harbour using only their skeleton crew. They realize that their chances are nil with only the men they have. As they are walking along the ship,Vincent, who is pretending to be ill, confronts Yardley and tells him that he has a plan to get them all out of there.\n\nElsewhere on the ship, Bones is telling Silver that the men are growing a support for Silver to be made Quartermaster. Bones tells Silver that the men know that if Silver had not cut the forestay that Vane would likely have sailed away and killed all of them. Yardley then appears and unchains Silver and takes him away. As he is being taken away, Bones and the rest of Flint's crew attempt to intervene and save Silver, but they are swiftly put back down.\n\nIn Charles Town, Flint's trial is taking place. The prosecutor is telling the assembled crowd about the numerous acts of piracy that Flint and his crew have committed. As the prosecutor continues to speak, he is interrupted by the arrival of Charles Vane. Vane states that he wants to be a character witness for Flint. He brings with him Abigail's diary that she wrote in during her trip to Charles Town wherein she wrote good things about Flint and Barlow and the other pirates. Later, in a closed session, the prosecutor tells Ashe that he could always throw the diary in the fire, but that he should not worry about allowing it into evidence because the jury has already made up their minds about Flint.\n\nIn Nassau, Max walks into Eleanor's tavern and findsFrasier. She states that she heard that the Consortium has been disbanded and that the only left is Frasier himself. Max offers to buy his interest in the tavern. She tells him that he has until sundown to accept or reject the offer.\n\nAboard Flint's ship, Silver is brought into the captain's cabin where Vincent is sitting in front of Jenks. Jenks explains that he needs Silver to influence several men on Flint's crew to join his crew so that he can adequately sail the ship. Silver figures out that the men who do not join Jenks's crew will be slaughtered and so Silver refuses to help. When he states his refusal, Jenks pulls out a pistol and shoots Vincent, killing him. Jenks then has Silver laid out across the table and proceeds to crush his leg with the hard end of an axe.\n\nIn Charles Town, Abigail's diary is being read aloud to the crowd as Flint and Vane sit shackled on the stage. On the outskirts of the town, Vane's men climb up the walls of the city and take out the gun crews who are standing guard. They turn the cannon from facing the sea and place them where they face the city and on Vane's signal, they open fire on the town. During the chaos that ensues from the artillery fire, Flint confronts Ashe and stabs him through the gut, mortally wounding him.\n\nAboard the ship, Jenks continues to crush Silver's leg until he gets word that the city is being successfully assaulted by Vane's men ashore. As Jenks goes to kill Silver, the men of Flint's crew smash into the captain's cabin and rescue Silver. Jenks is killed by a sword slash from Billy Bones.\n\nIn the city, Flint and Vane fight their way to the jetty and begin to escape on a rowing boat. Colonel Rhett and his men begin to fire at the boat and even prepare to fire a cannon at them when they are killed by artillery fire from Flint's ship.

Rackham tells her that the Spanish men on the beach put up an admirable fight, but that they won the day. Rackham's crew also had to salvage theWalrusin order to carry it all back to Nassau.

He tells Max that although he has been placed in charge of restoring the fortress at Nassau, he cannot get any men to do the work and the restoration has come to a halt.\n\nIn theGovernor's Mansion,Anne BonnyconfrontsRackhamabout his lack of oversight concerning the restoration of the fortress. Rackham is then confronted by Vane, who has returned from his last expedition. Vane suggests that Rackham purposely had Vane attack a ship that had slaves on it so that the slaves could be used to rebuild the fort. Vane is averse to using slaves for the fort's restoration, likely stemming from his experience as a forced laborer underAlbinus, but Rackham's convinces him that it is the only way to rebuild the fort.\n\nAboard theWalrus, QuartermasterJohn Silverattempts to convince Flint that he needs to stop going ashore on the raids against magistrates. Silver states that there is an escalating danger of Flint being killed and that the men of Nassau can't afford to lose Flint. Flint rejects the idea, claiming that the name \"Flint\" is what scares people and that he must go ashore each time. Later,Dr. Howellinspects Silver's stump and tells him that if he doesn't continue to clean it, he'll have to remove more of Silver's leg.\n\nA ship is then spotted in the distance, with her sails up, flying the colors of Captain Hallendale. Silver gives the order to move in and investigate. Flint tells Silver that he feels that they shouldn't go investigate because it will cause unnecessary delay, but goes along with it anyways. When they board the ship, they find it completely empty, save for the corpse of Captain Hallendale, chained to his chair inside the Captain's cabin. He had apparently been marooned by his crew and went mad from drinking sea water.Billy Bonesand Flint can't figure out why would he be marooned on a ship rather than being left on an island to be marooned. It soon dawns on both of them that it is a trap. At the same time as their realization, Silver spots sails in the distance; it is a large and powerful Royal Navy hunter heading right for them. Flint states the approaching ship has them in a terrible spot.\n\nAs the ship approaches, it is revealed to beCaptain Hornigoldand his crew who have now become pirate hunters, sanctioned by the Royal Navy. Hornigold tells theWalruscrew that if they surrender peacefully, he has the power to grant all of them pardons, as he had previously done with Captain Hallendale's men. Flint then gives an impassioned speech to his men, stating that he will never surrender to that thing, England, that has done so much harm to him. He then convinces his crew that they should never surrender either, stating that they are winning the war. Since he cannot outrun and cannot outgun Hornigold's ship, he sails theWalrusdirectly into a massive storm, knowing that Hornigold will not pursue.\n\nIn England, Eleanor lingers in her dank jail cell. A man enters and tells her that if she cooperates with him in restoring order to Nassau, he can grant her a full pardon. He tells her that his name isWoodes Rogers, the new governor of New Providence island. He demands that she make a list of names of men who can be swayed and those who cannot be. She tells him that if he wants to civilize Nassau, the only name he needs to concern himself with is Charles Vane. She tells Rogers that as long as Vane is alive, that Rogers cannot succeed.\n\nBack in Nassau, Vane and Rackham sit in the room where all of their gold is hidden. They discuss how the gold has brought them very little so far. Vane states that he fears they have upset the order of things so much, that the response from England or Spain will be completely overwhelming.\n\nElsewhere in Nassau, Blackbeard arrives and asks for the location of an old friend of his: Charles Vane.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The episode opens with Captain Flint in the middle of a dream. He is chasing several ghostly figures around the ship, including his former loverMiranda Barlow, but before he can catch her he is awoken byBilly Bones, who tells him that Captain Hornigold has began to close the gap between their two ships. Flint reaffirms his command to sail into a terrible storm to escape Hornigold. As usual, Flint’s orders are obsessive and with little regard for others.\n\nElsewhere on the ship, QuartermasterJohn Silvertells Bones that they should have taken Hornigold's pardons and then after they were safe to reject those pardons.\n\nOnWoodes Rogers'sship,Eleanor Guthrieis summoned to the quarterdeck to speak to Rogers. Rogers shows her his fleet and explains to that the moment he suspects that she is not cooperating, he is sending her back to England to hang aboard their smallest ship. Eleanor is not intimidated and states to Rogers that there is no way that he can accomplish his goals of subjecting Nassau without her intricate knowledge of the personalities on the island.\n\nIn Nassau, Rackham's quartermaster,Featherstone, is having to disperse more of a pirate's share after that pirate explains that he misplaced and lost his previous dispersement. They are interrupted by Max, who wishes to speak alone to Rackham. Max tries to persuade Rackham to exchange all of their gold, which sits perilously inside an unprotected fort, for commodities that are easier to transport should they need to abandon the island.\n\nBack on theWalrus, the men prepare to head into the storm. Crew members stand ready in the top sails ready to pull them in at Flint's command. Beneath decks,Muldoonand Silver attempt to plug holes that have opened in the hull. Silver explains to Muldoon how useless he feels, but Muldoon explains to Silver how the entire crew is indebted to him. Back up top, Flint orders that the main sails and the topgallants be raised, but the topgallants are stuck.\n\nOn Rogers's ship, Eleanor explains to Rogers how she took power in Nassau. She states that to consolidate power, she identified the most dangerous pirate and threw him off the island. This pirate wasEdward Teach. She continues by telling Rogers that she also convinced Teach's protégé to switch sides and to join with her. This man wasCharles Vane. Eleanor tells him that she had a romantic relationship with Vane, which infuriates Rogers, who thinks that Eleanor is only returning to Nassau to settle a feud with her ex-lover. Eleanor convinces him otherwise, stating that she wants to see Nassau returned to validity, as her father had helped create it.\n\nBack in Nassau, Vane is surprised in his tent by Edward Teach. Vane is at first unclear of Teach's intentions, but Teach gives him a hug and tells Vane that he forgives him for betraying him for a girl all those years ago. Teach tells Vane that for years all he wanted to do was return to Nassau and that when he heard that the Guthries had been deposed that it was time for him to return.\n\nBack on theWalrus, the men are still struggling to get the sails either reeled in or cut away when a massive squall approaches and nearly knocks the ship over. As the ship almost tips over, a cannon comes loose below decks and crushes Muldoon's leg against the side of the ship. Unable to free Muldoon's leg, the water below decks begins to rise. Silver holds Muldoon's hand as Muldoon slowly drowns.De Groottells Flint that the only way that the ship can avoid being sunk is for the topgallants to be cut away. Flint finally grabs an ax and personally cuts them away, leading to the death of several crewmen as they fall into the sea.\n\nIn Nassau, Teach and Vane enter theGovernor's Mansionto explain their plans to defend Nassau. Teach is less than impressed at Rackham's status as a partner, because he remembers Rackham as a scrawny crew member. Vane tries to defend Rackham, relating how he rose through the ranks. But, Teach sees it as a sign that Nassau has become weak. He demonstrates his ruthlessness, by having two potential crewmates fight to the death to join his crew. This convinces Rackham that Blackbeard is a volcano building towards its inevitable eruption, and to agree to Max's plan - as long as it's done quietly.\n\nBack on Rogers's ship, Hornigold comes aboard. He is shocked to see Eleanor on the ship, but goes on to explain that he drove Flint's ship into a storm. He found enough wreckage to convince him that Captain Flint is dead.\n\nOn theWalrus, Flint wakes from another dream having been knocked out in the storm. On deck, he learns that the ship is badly damaged, and many of the crew injured. They are now becalmed in the Sargasso Sea, their food and fresh water mostly lost, and many miles from land.\n\n",

We also get a small little glimpse into Berringer's soul, via the picture-locket of his wife and child; he, perhaps, wasn't always a bitter and vengeful man.\n\nInNassau, while lounging naked in bed with a female lover,Maxis arrested and brought to Captain Berringer. Berringer had a spy follow Max the night before, and knows she met withJohn Silver. He threatens her with charges of treason if she doesn’t give up her informants, but Max refuses and meets his gaze with equal resolve.\n\nAt sea,Blackbeardis closing in on the Governor’s ship.Anne BonnyandJack Rackhamdiscuss their relationship. Anne can see that the days of the legendary outlaws of the open sea are coming to an end, but Rackham is blinded by the stars in his eyes when he stands on the quarterdeck next to Blackbeard; his ego demands he go down in history.\n\nOn the other side of the island,James FlintandMadireassert their alliance after the debacle at theUnderhillplantation. Meeting with her contacts in Nassau, Madi learns that Silver is alive; and, of course, is a wanted man.\n\nAtIsrael Hands’ hideaway, it seems that he and John Silver have formed a working relationship, with Silver no longer in manacles. But their respite is short-lived, as the redcoats suddenly arrive at their camp with search dogs. However, when they’re finally hunted down and cornered, Flint and his men turn up and save them. Afterwards, in a rare sweet moment, Silver is reunited with Madi.\n\nBack at sea, after raking Rogers’ ship with cannon fire, Blackbeard and Bonny lead the boarding party on the long-boats. Once aboard, something doesn’t feel right and with good reason. Rogers springs his trap and a bloody battle ensues. In the end, the unthinkable happens; Blackbeard is captured. Rackham and the crew aboard The Revenge watch helplessly from afar, and unfurl the white flag.\n\nBack in Nassau,Eleanor Guthrie’s trip to Philadelphia has also been waylaid. She storms into Captain Berringer’s office while he is trying to verbally beat a confession out of Max. In a private chat, Eleanor berates Max for not turning Silver over to Berringer, but Max reminds her of how the last prominent pirate was dealt with, and the pirate resistance it incited. Their meeting is ended by the news that Long John Silver is to return to Nassau.\n\nBack at sea, Rogers has Blackbeard strung up by the ankles over the side of the ship. While Rackham, Bonny, and the crew look on, Teach is callously keelhauled, dragging him under the ship covered with razor sharp barnacles. After the first pass, he’s so bloodied and scraped. The second pass sees Teach apparently dead, as his entire body is flayed, but not so; he coughs up sea water. Everyone looks on as Blackbeard’s brutalised body is dragged from the water for a third time; miraculously still alive. Woodes grand moment has been ruined, and he petulantly shoots him in the head at point blank. Rackham has been spared, as he was to be next in line.\n\nBack in Nassau, Captain Berringer lays on the hangings of the pirates with full public spectacle to draw Silver in, despite Eleanor’s warning to deal with the pirates quietly. Meanwhile, John Silver rides his horse into downtown Nassau flanked by Flint and Israel Hands, like a scene from a classic western. Berringer stands ready with his men as the pirates enter the square. An intense and bloody skirmish ensues. Inspired by their Pirate King, the townspeople and slaves join the revolt. However, it looks like the redcoats have Silver and the pirates down, when in the nick of timeBilly Bonesand his men show up. In the end, Israel Hands has Berringer under his knife. He looks to Silver for the go ahead, before slitting Berringer’s throat. Nassau has just been overtaken by the pirates, as Eleanor and Max flee to Fort Nassau.\n\n",

The slaves are being cruelly disciplined, beaten with burning brooms, to instill fear against joining the pirate revolt. One in particular seems defiant, a slave namedJulius. Soon word comes in...Nassauhas fallen.\n\nIn Nassau, chaos reigns in the streets, with old hurts being settled by knife and gunfire. Amongst the madness,Eleanor Guthrieescapes and finds safety inFort Nassau withthe remnants of the Governor's redcoats. Eleanor immediately takes charge, butMaxis missing. Meanwhile,James FlintandJohn Silverwrestle with re-establishing order. While Flint organises a new Captain’s Council, it’s Silver’s word that rules, although for now they are of one mind. A note arrives from Eleanor offering a prisoner exchange, twenty captured pirates for Max, whoBilly Boneshas.\n\nAt sea,Woodes Rogersspots and intercepts a boat that had just escaped New Providence, and learns that Nassau has fallen. He orders one of his lieutenants to take his sloop and deliver the chained up pirates to Port Royal to hang, while he heads back to Nassau onBlackbeard’sMan O’ War. The lieutenant agrees, but first he’ll dole out a little retribution.Jack RackhamandAnne Bonnywatch as one by one the crew are pitted against the hulkingMr. Miltonin a fight and bludgeoned to death.\n\nBack in Nassau, Silver confronts Billy Bones none too pleased with him. It is a tense exchange that shows how much they’ve both grown. Billy pleads with him to remember a time when neither of them bought into Flint’s crusade. Flint will trample anyone who's in his way, includingMadi. Silver is more than a little affected by Billy’s words.\n\nWith Max finally in his hands, Silver asks her about the night she tried to detain him, and what she would have done with him. Max tells him of a place her spies found in Florida, where the English aristocracy send troublesome family members to disappear, and be cared for in secret. The allusion is clear toThomas Hamiltonbeing alive.\n\nBack at sea, Bonny has had enough. Why survive only to swing in Port Royal ? She convinces Jack not to name another pirate, certain she’ll be picked her next. And she is. In the bloody brawl against the English bruiser, Anne is almost pummeled to death, but desperately manages to grab the keys, and free her brethren. They join the fight, and take the ship, but Anne is left barely alive.\n\nMeanwhile in the interior, Julius and the slaves have started their own revolt, and their numbers are growing. The problem is that this powerful army of slaves are angry at everyone, including the pirates.\n\nBack in Nassau, Max is exchange for the twenty pirate prisoners includingMr. De Groot. During the trade, Silver asks Flint if he would end his war against the British Empire, if he could have Thomas Hamilton back, but Flint just responds in platitudes. Inside the fort, Eleanor, who is revealed to be pregnant, finally has a quiet moment with Max. There is regret in her voice. Eleanor and Woodes have constantly ignored Max's many warnings, and it’s now clear that Nassau will never be what either of them wanted it to become. They concoct a plan to leave Nassau behind them... for good.\n\nDespite learning that Rogers is already on his way back to Nassau, Eleanor holds a secret meeting with Flint and Silver to strike a bargain. She is ready to quit and will surrender the fort without a fight, in exchange forUrcagold and safe-passage out of Nassau.

This is the fight he’s been preparing them for, and they are ready for anything. Anything butJohn Silvertelling them that the fight is off. The deal has been done; the pirates are buying Nassau, in exchange for the cache of stolenUrcagold.\n\nMrs. Hudsonrows out to Rogers’ ship to persuade him to sail for Port Royal, and awaitEleanor Guthrie’s arrival with the gold. Rogers is less than thrilled to be asked to cut the ties with what represents his entire mission in life… the destruction of the pirate problem. Mrs. Hudson does her damnedest to convince him Eleanor is doing this out of devotion to him, but he refuses to listen and continues his approach. However, Eleanor makes her point by firing warning shots fromFort Nassau. It takes several shots to get him to leave the area… but not to Port Royal !\n\nOn Nassau beach, Silver updatesMadion the situation and is shocked when she takesJames Flint’s side; holding Nassau without the gold will be difficult, but sacrifices must be made. And speaking of sacrifices, they must repair the damaged alliance with the plantation slaves, by giving them Billy.\n\nIn Nassau Fort, Eleanor asks Flint about the fate ofMr. Scott. He confirms that he’s dead, and also about hiswifeanddaughter, and theMaroon Islandcommunity. Eleanor feels betrayed that the one man she trusted, had in turn not trusted her at all; just another man who used her for his own ends. Flint ends the conversation by asking if Woodes Rogers is truly any different.\n\nAt sea, Rogers makes the audacious decision to sails toSpanishCuba, despite the current state of war between England and Spain. Met by Spanish soldiers at the dock, Rogers dumps the head ofBlackbeardat the lieutenant’s feet, and asks for a meeting with the governor.\n\nBack in Nassau, Billy boldly offers to kill Eleanor and Flint during the exchange for the gold. Silver appears to agree, but takes himself off alone to decide between betraying Flint or Billy. Maudlin and indecisive, Silver seeks council fromIsrael Hands. However, instead of offering friendly advice, Hands slaps him; insecurity is not a good trait in a Pirate King.\n\nBack in Cuba, Rogers meets withGovernor Raja. He will do anything to accomplish the destruction of the pirate problem; a problem that threatens Cuban interests also, and is funded with stolen Spanish gold. Rogers makes a deal with the Governor that’s surely an act of treason, inviting the Spanish navy to invade and sack the English territory of Nassau.\n\nBack in Nassau, Silver notifies the fort that he doesn’t want the exchange happening in full view of the beach and changes the location. This makes Eleanor twitchy, but Flint reassures her. Meanwhile outside the tunnel, with his men hidden in the bushes, Billy thinks he is waiting to ambush Eleanor and Flint. However,Jacob Garrettcomes up and tells him that this isn’t so; Jacob has been charged with killing him. Nonetheless, Jacob refuses, telling Silver’s men that they’ve forgotten who they should be following; their oaths were given to Billy, when Long John Silver was just a fiction. With a look, John sends in Israel Hands to take them both out. The fight is quick. Jacob is killed, and Billy beaten to within an inch of his life. However, Silver stops Hands from delivering the killing blow, and orders Billy delivered to the plantation slaves.\n\nElsewhere, Eleanor and Flint emerge via a different tunnel, where Madi and her people are waiting, and lead them to a secluded beach. However, the only thing waiting from them isJack Rackhamwith a small crew; the ship that was seen approaching was Jack’s and not the one sent to retrieve the gold. When Flint informs him of the exchange, Rackham is visibly shocked; having seen Rogers for the kind of man he truly is, he’ll never accept such a deal, and will be coming back.\n\nIn the end at Fort Nassau,Maxsees something out on the horizon that instils dread and fear… a whole fleet of Spanish ships approaching Nassau.\n\n",

There are mixed emotions. Madi bitterly recalls how her parent really trusted no white people, not even Eleanor. Meanwhile, Eleanor is finally ready to leave this chaos; as long as it is to live with someone she loves who loves her back.

Silver has become weary of this war against civilization, but Flint reassures him that they have the right people to lead them once the war is won; Silver andMadi. He could be saying it with all sincerity, but it also feels like a placation.\n\nThe next day with theWalrusin range, Rogers executes the men Flint had sent ashore to rescue Madi, and then moves on to Madi herself. Silver ordersIsrael Handsto bring up theUrcachest, much to Flint’s bewilderment and helplessness. Rogers then weighs anchor and sets sail, with the Walrus following behind.\n\nBack in Nassau,Mrs. Hudsonhas foundEleanor’s journal, and heads to the brothel to speak withMrs. Mapleton. She offers her information from inside the Governor’s mansion that could help Mapleton get back on the council, in exchange for safe passage back toLondon. Mapleton does indeed take some information and goes to her office were someone is waiting;Captain Jack Rackham. He now knows where Rogers and Flint are heading… Isle de los Esqueletos.\n\nInPhiladelphia,Anne BonnyasksIdelleto get her a ship accepting passengers so she can leave. However, Idelle takes a moment to unburden her soul; she reminds Bonny that she killed her friendCharlottefor no good reason and thatMaxwas the reason she wasn’t killed for it. And yet, she wants to throw that away. Meanwhile, Max is trying to secure their alliance withMarion Guthrie. Grandmother Guthrie sees Max as a woman to be reckoned with, however there is a catch. Max must marry someone easily manipulated with little ambition, but a man from society none the less. It seems an easy choice for Max who’s usually led by her survival instincts. However, she decides not to marry into Mrs. Guthrie's scheme, for fear that it will ruin her chances of rekindling things with Bonny.\n\nBack at sea, the ships arrive at Skeleton Island, caked in mist and mystery. On the Walrus during dinner, Israel Hands insists that Flint will betray him and must die, but Silver won’t listen. Israel may be psycho but he isn’t wrong. That night, Flint andDooleysneak into the hold to steal the chest. Hands catches them in the act, but lets them go to prove his point. Sometime later, the pair are seen taking the cache off of the Walrus and hiding it somewhere on the island.\n\nIn the end, Long John Silver comes face to face with Rogers on his ship. He reassures Rogers that he has sent six men to retrieve the cache and kill Flint. In the background, the look on Billy’s face says \"If only you'd killed Flint when I told you to!”\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A series of flashbacks throughout the episode take us back to whenJames FlintandJohn Silverwere more aligned than ever. A few weeks earlier on theMaroon Island, Silver was being schooled on how to properly sword fight, when Flint realises that he doesn’t really know Silver’s past; the boys’ home origin tale is clearly fabricated. Our past is the only insight into our base motivations. For as committed as they are to each other’s futures, it bothers Flint that Silver insists on keeping his past a complete mystery.\n\nIn the present onSkeleton Island, Silver is ferried ashore to joinIsrael Handsand five others in furiously hunting for Flint before he buries theUrcacache. However, Flint’s superior strategy serves him well. He manages to fool the group into splitting up, and then takes out three of the men single-handedly.\n\nOn the governor’s ship,Woodes Rogersseems to be at war with himself, haunted by his guilt over Eleanor’s death, which reinforces his cruel nature. When he askedBilly Boneswhich one will prevail, Billy admits that it will most likely be Flint and he should make his move now. However, Rogers wants to see if he can turnMadionce more. Below deck, Rogers quietly reads Madi the riot act: he has no regard for “her kind” and despises the idea of compromise, but wishes to deal with her for Silver’s life. However, a calm and collected Madi has the interests of her people firmly in mind and picks the cause over the man.\n\nMeanwhile enroute to Skeleton Island,Jack Rackhamspeaks withMr. McCoy, the old man who sailed withAveryand knows the way to Skeleton Island. The philosophical old sailor tells Jack just what he wants to hear; to hold onto the pirate life for as long as he can. Later, all Jack’s optimism vanishes when one of the crew informs him that the old man has had a heart-attack. Jack turns toFeatherstoneand tells him he’d better have taken notes from the old geezer or there will be hell to pay.\n\nBack on Skeleton Island,Dooleyhas sided with Flint all the way. However, they are found byJojiand another pirate. Pairing up, Flint takes out the other guy, while Joji pins Dooley’s hand to the ground without killing him, as if to say that he didn’t want to kill his brother. It’s one hell of a fight between Flint and Joji, but in the end the silent and deadly pirate is killed.\n\nBack on theWalrus, Silver's plan always seemed rather foolhardy, as it relied on Rogers keeping his word and not murdering everyone regardless. Under the cover of the island’s thick fog, Rogers has a few of his redcoats swim out and set the Walrus on fire.Mr. DeGroot, unable to put out the flames, orders the men to abandon ship. With the pirates bobbing in the water, longboats filled with redcoats begin picking them off like fish in a barrel. DeGroot himself is shot in the head. The thing that hurts most is that Billy leads the redcoats. When he locks eye withBen Gunn, in a brief moment of humanity he lets him go.\n\nBack on Skeleton Island, after a skirmish with Israel Hands, Flint subdues him, and the final confrontation between Silver and Flint begins. After all that’s happened, Flint is still willing to talk reasonably with him, but Dooley comes up behind Silver with pistol drawn. Flint doesn’t hesitate, and instinctively shoots Dooley to save his life. However for Silver, Flint has just killed yet another man in the name of his own cause. Silver attacks. The fight is short but ferocious. They seemed equals at this point. Silver so desperately wants to kill him, while Flint so desperately wants to avoid this fight. The only thing that saves either one is the sound of explosions from the Walrus.\n\nIn the end, Flint, Silver and Hands get to the cliff that overlooks the ships, and see the Walrus; the ship that has lived on borrowed time for so long is finally done in.\n\n",

In the book, Flint and six men bury the treasure, which also includes a great deal of silver and gold, after which he kills all six. In this episode, it is a single chest of jewels, and the events surrounding the deaths of the six men are different.

    "synopsis": "The final episode opens on the estate inSavannahGeorgia where the rich hide their troublesome family members to live in anonymity. One ofNassau’s captains,Tom Morgan, sits with the society man who owns the plantation and asks if they have a particular person incarcerated there. When the owner refuses to divulge any info, Morgan informs him that he representsLong John Silver, and the owner’s attitude abruptly changes.\n\nOnSkeleton Island,James Flintand Silver scramble to save as many of theWalrus’ crew as they can, while the redcoats continue shooting them from the longboats.Woodes Rogersorders his men to give no quarter, with just one exception; to capture Flint alive with his knowledge of the treasure. Things look bad until there’s a signal from theEurydice…Jack Rackhamhas arrived. While Rogers heads out to sea, Rackham picks up the survivors.\n\nBefore giving pursuit, Rackham, Silver and Flint have a sit-down in the captain’s cabin to settle some of their differences. Flint demands to know where Rackham has been, and Rackham explains his meeting inPhiladelphiawithEleanor Guthrie’sgrandfather, but leaves out the details. Meanwhile, Flint insists on taking command of their pursuit of Rogers, which Silver grudgingly agrees to, leading Rackham to walk away in disgust.\n\nAs theLionleaves the inlet, Rogers is waiting for them, and Flint orders them to ram him. While climbing the rigging to turn the Eurydice’s broadside to them, Flint clashes withBilly Boneshigh in the crow’s-nest and among the sails. The fight is brutal and ends with Billy falling once again into the sea; Billy is later revealed to be marooned on Skeleton Island. Meanwhile, Rackham leads the mass of men fighting on maindeck. Through the chaos, he spots Rogers and the pair face off. Rogers seems to be getting the upper hand, when Flint joins the fray. Finally outmatched, Rogers is defeated and the pirates overtake the ship. With Rogers at his mercy, Rackham informs him that he will not be keelhauled; instead he has a far more humiliating end in mind.\n\nWhile all this is going on, Silver goes below to searches forMadi, and meets… himself; a cowardly crewman who claims to be “just the cook.” The cook leads him to the cell where he’s finally reunited with his beloved, still alive.\n\nWith Madi safe, Silver, Flint, and some men row ashore to retrieve the treasure. Only… Flint won’t take them to it until he can clear the air with Silver one more time. This time, Silver has something to say. Standing opposite him, gun pointed at his chest, Silver believes he’s seen Flint’s war for what it truly is: the senseless violence of a man with nothing left to lose and just wants to see the world burn. Flint bites back that Silver’s life with Madi will eventually prove hollow, and sooner or later, he’ll want proof that he mattered. However, Silver is resolute in his stance; the war against civilisation is over, and he begs Flint to yield willingly.\n\nJack returns to Philadelphia to bring word that Captain Flint is no longer a concern to them. He’s not dead, but retired.Mrs. Guthrieisn’t exactly pleased with the outcome, butMaxand Rackham assure her that Flint is now not a martyr to the cause and will never be heard from again. Before the deal is struck, Rackham requests one more favour; to be involved in the writing of an affidavit against the disgraced Governor Rogers.\n\nOn theMaroon Island, Silver explains the same to a devastated Madi, who wanted the war to echo across the New World as much as Flint did. Flint has been taken to the Savannah plantation, and money changed hands to have him incarcerated. As Flint is escorted to Thomas Hamilton, the man whose death had given birth to Flint, the old McGraw seems to re-emerge. Madi initially demands that Silver leave, but in the end she realises that Silver did the best he could for their partner, and returns to his side.\n\nSome months later, Rackham sits in the tavern inNassauspeaking with a young recruit for his crew. He explains that Nassau is now a legitimate flourishing port, while in the background the new GovernorAugustus Featherstoneshakes hands with yet more respectable business partner, withIdelleat his side. From the balcony opposite, Max looks on with a smile, the real power behind the throne. Rackham finishes, with a wink, that piracy of course is strictly disapproved of.\n\nIn the end, Rackham leads the young kid aboard his ship, and introduces him to Anne Bonny asMark Read; Bonny just rolls her eyes. Below them on the main deck, some of the crew unfurl Rackham’s flag… the Skull & Cross-Swords. Disappointed, Rackham feels it might need one more change.\n\n",
