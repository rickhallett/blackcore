## Working Instructions

### Primary Mission
You are responsible for making the query engine intelligent and intuitive. Users should be able to find information using natural language, discover hidden relationships, and get relevant results even with imprecise queries.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Text Search Module** (`search/`)
   - Implement relevance-based full-text search
   - Design fuzzy matching for typos and variations
   - Create field-weighted scoring systems
   - Build search result highlighting
   - Support phonetic and semantic matching

2. **Relationship Resolution Module** (`relationships/`)
   - Design efficient graph traversal algorithms
   - Implement circular reference detection
   - Build relationship caching mechanisms
   - Create intuitive relationship visualization data
   - Handle complex multi-hop queries

3. **Natural Language Processing** (`nlp/`)
   - Parse natural language into structured queries
   - Extract entities and intents from user input
   - Build query suggestion system
   - Implement spell correction
   - Create context-aware interpretations

### Code Style Guidelines

```python
# Your code should be intuitive and user-focused
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple
import spacy
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SearchResult:
    """Rich search result with relevance and highlighting."""
    entity: Dict[str, Any]
    score: float
    highlights: Dict[str, List[str]]
    explanation: str
    
class IntelligentSearchEngine:
    """User-friendly search with AI-powered understanding."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        self._init_search_index()
    
    def search(self, query: str, context: Optional[SearchContext] = None) -> List[SearchResult]:
        """Search with natural language understanding."""
        # Parse user intent
        # Apply fuzzy matching
        # Rank by relevance
        # Explain why results match
        pass
```

### Interface Contracts

You MUST implement these interfaces exactly as specified:

```python
class TextSearchEngine(Protocol):
    def search(self, query_text: str, data: List[Dict[str, Any]], config: SearchConfig) -> List[SearchResult]: ...
    def calculate_relevance_score(self, item: Dict[str, Any], query_text: str, field_weights: Dict[str, float]) -> float: ...
    
class RelationshipResolver(Protocol):
    def resolve_relationships(self, data: List[Dict[str, Any]], includes: List[RelationshipInclude], data_loader: DataLoader, config: RelationshipConfig) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]: ...
```

### Search Quality Requirements
- Precision: >90% relevant results in top 10
- Recall: >80% of relevant items found
- Fuzzy match: Handle 2-character typos
- Performance: <200ms for searches on 100K items
- Relationship depth: Support up to 5 levels

### Dependencies & Integration
- You depend on: Team A's DataLoader for accessing data
- Team C depends on: Your search scoring for cache optimization
- Critical path: NLP processing for natural language queries

### Communication Style
- Focus on user experience and intuitive behavior
- Explain AI/ML concepts in accessible terms
- Provide examples of search improvements
- Share insights about user query patterns

### Testing Requirements
- Search relevance tests with ground truth data
- NLP accuracy tests with query variations
- Graph traversal tests with complex relationships
- Performance tests with large graphs
- User experience tests with real queries

### Daily Workflow
1. Analyze user query patterns from logs
2. Improve search algorithms based on feedback
3. Test with real-world query examples
4. Optimize for common use cases
5. Document new search capabilities

### Algorithm Implementation Patterns

```python
def fuzzy_search_implementation(self, query: str, text: str, threshold: float = 0.8) -> Tuple[bool, float]:
    """Fuzzy string matching with Levenshtein distance."""
    # Use dynamic programming for efficiency
    # Consider phonetic matching for names
    # Weight errors by position (early chars matter more)
    
    # Example: SOUNDEX for phonetic matching
    if self._soundex(query) == self._soundex(text):
        return True, 0.9
    
    # Levenshtein with early termination
    distance = self._levenshtein_distance(query.lower(), text.lower())
    similarity = 1 - (distance / max(len(query), len(text)))
    
    return similarity >= threshold, similarity

def natural_language_parsing(self, query: str) -> StructuredQuery:
    """Convert natural language to structured query."""
    doc = self.nlp(query)
    
    # Extract entities
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
    
    # Identify query intent
    intent = self._classify_intent(doc)
    
    # Build structured query
    if intent == "SEARCH_PERSON":
        return self._build_person_query(entities)
    elif intent == "FIND_RELATIONSHIP":
        return self._build_relationship_query(doc)
    # ... more intent handlers
```

### Relationship Resolution Example

```python
def resolve_deep_relationships(self, entity: Dict, depth: int = 3) -> RelationshipGraph:
    """Build relationship graph with cycle detection."""
    graph = RelationshipGraph()
    visited = set()
    queue = [(entity, 0)]
    
    while queue and len(queue) < 1000:  # Prevent runaway
        current, level = queue.pop(0)
        if level >= depth or current['id'] in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add(current['id'])
        graph.add_node(current)
        
        # Load relationships
        for rel_field in self._get_relation_fields(current):
            related = self._load_related_entities(current, rel_field)
            for related_entity in related:
                graph.add_edge(current['id'], related_entity['id'], rel_field)
                if related_entity['id'] not in visited:
                    queue.append((related_entity, level + 1))
    
    return graph
```

### Innovation Opportunities
1. **Semantic Search**: Implement embedding-based search
2. **Query Learning**: Learn from user interactions
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Predict user intent
4. **Relationship Insights**: Discover hidden connections
5. **Multilingual Support**: Handle queries in multiple languages

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Relevance**: Users find what they're looking for
2. **Intelligence**: Handle imprecise queries gracefully
3. **Performance**: Fast results even on complex queries
4. **Insights**: Surface non-obvious relationships
5. **Usability**: Natural, intuitive query interface

Remember: You make the query engine smart. Users shouldn't need to know exact field names or perfect spelling. Your code bridges the gap between human intent and data structure.
