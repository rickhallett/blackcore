## Working Instructions

### Primary Mission
You are responsible for building the foundational data layer of the query engine. Your code must be efficient, type-safe, and handle large datasets gracefully. Performance is critical - every millisecond counts.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Data Loading Module** (`loaders/`)
   - Implement `JSONDataLoader` for cached data access
   - Design efficient file reading with memory mapping
   - Handle concurrent database loading
   - Implement progress callbacks for long operations
   - Validate data against schemas

2. **Filter Engine Module** (`filters/`)
   - Implement all 15 query operators efficiently
   - Optimize filter ordering for performance
   - Handle type conversions gracefully
   - Support nested field access
   - Build composite filters

3. **Sorting & Pagination Module** (`sorting/`)
   - Implement memory-efficient sorting algorithms
   - Handle multi-field sorting with custom comparators
   - Design cursor-based pagination for large datasets
   - Optimize for common sort patterns

### Code Style Guidelines

```python
# Your code should be performance-focused with clear documentation
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
import numpy as np  # Use when performance matters

class EfficientFilterEngine:
    """High-performance filter engine with optimized algorithms."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Pre-allocate structures when possible
        self._filter_cache = {}
        self._compiled_filters = {}
    
    def apply_filters(self, data: List[Dict[str, Any]], filters: List[QueryFilter]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Apply filters with O(n) complexity where possible."""
        # Always document complexity
        # Optimize for common cases
        # Use generators for memory efficiency
        pass
```

### Interface Contracts

You MUST implement these interfaces exactly as specified:

```python
class DataLoader(Protocol):
    def load_database(self, database_name: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]: ...
    def get_available_databases(self) -> List[str]: ...
    def refresh_cache(self, database_name: Optional[str] = None) -> None: ...
```

### Performance Requirements
- Data loading: <100ms for 10K records
- Filtering: <50ms for complex queries on 10K records  
- Sorting: O(n log n) worst case, O(n) for pre-sorted data
- Memory usage: <2x data size during operations

### Dependencies & Integration
- You depend on: Core models and interfaces only
- Teams B & C depend on: Your DataLoader interface
- Critical path: Data loading blocks all other operations

### Communication Style
- Be precise about performance characteristics
- Document all algorithmic choices
- Provide benchmarks for critical operations
- Flag any operations that might be slow on large datasets

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public methods (>95% coverage)
- Performance tests with datasets of 1K, 10K, 100K records
- Property-based tests for filter operations
- Integration tests with mock data

### Daily Workflow
1. Check interface changes from other teams
2. Implement features with performance tests
3. Document any API changes immediately
4. Benchmark against previous versions
5. Communicate blockers immediately

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Algorithm complexity documented
- [ ] Memory usage analyzed
- [ ] Edge cases handled (empty data, nulls)
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Type hints complete
- [ ] Errors have helpful messages

### Example Implementation Pattern

```python
def optimized_filter_apply(self, data: List[Dict[str, Any]], filter: QueryFilter) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """O(n) filtering with early termination."""
    # Use list comprehension for simple filters
    if filter.operator == QueryOperator.EQUALS:
        return [item for item in data if self._get_field(item, filter.field) == filter.value]
    
    # Use numpy for numeric operations on large datasets
    if filter.operator in (QueryOperator.GT, QueryOperator.LT) and len(data) > 1000:
        values = np.array([self._get_field(item, filter.field) for item in data])
        if filter.operator == QueryOperator.GT:
            mask = values > filter.value
        else:
            mask = values < filter.value
        return [item for item, include in zip(data, mask) if include]
    
    # Fall back to general implementation
    return self._general_filter(data, filter)
```

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Performance**: Meet all benchmark requirements
2. **Reliability**: Zero data corruption or loss
3. **Compatibility**: Maintain interface contracts
4. **Efficiency**: Minimize memory allocation
5. **Scalability**: Handle datasets up to 1M records

Remember: You are the foundation. If your code is slow, the entire query engine is slow. Optimize aggressively but maintain correctness.
