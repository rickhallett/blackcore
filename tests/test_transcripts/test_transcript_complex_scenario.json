  "content": "BARRY CADE: Good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining this emergency session. Following Phil's successful election to the council yesterday, we need to coordinate our next moves quickly. The DCF and Hollister won't take this lying down.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Thanks Barry. Can everyone hear Sandra on the phone?\n\nSANDRA WILLIAMS: [Phone audio] Yes, I'm here. Congratulations Phil! Things are moving fast at County. The Statistics Authority accepted your complaint - the investigation starts Monday.\n\nMARGARET THORNE: That's excellent news. I've been in touch with three other councillors who are ready to support a motion to suspend the Shore Rd closure pending investigation.\n\nUNKNOWN SPEAKER 1: Sorry to interrupt, I'm Detective Inspector Rachel Kumar from Dorset Police. I'm here because we've received complaints about harassment during the campaign. Mr. Harrison from the News filed a report.\n\nMICHAEL HARRINGTON: [Interjecting] That's not me! That's Mike Harrison - different person entirely. I'm Michael from the Gazette. We're actually rivals.\n\nDI RACHEL KUMAR: My apologies. Mr. Mike Harrison then. He claims your canvassers were aggressive.\n\nJAMES MORRISON: That's completely false. We have video evidence of him harassing our volunteers. Emma Watson took photos.\n\nBARRY CADE: DI Kumar, we'll cooperate fully. James, get Emma's evidence to the Detective Inspector today.\n\nALICE CHEN: Can we discuss the business impact? My association now has 23 members, including both Patels from Newton Rd and the new Turkish restaurant on High St - Ankara Delights, owned by the Özturk family.\n\nDR. JENNIFER HART: From a medical perspective, I've prepared a report showing that Shore Road is used by 67% of emergency vehicles reaching North Swanage. Closing it adds an average of 4.3 minutes to response times.\n\nUNKNOWN SPEAKER 2: Hi, I'm Tom Chen - Alice's son. I'm a data analyst at Dorset Digital, and I've been analyzing the survey data. The CAPTCHA didn't just reduce responses - it specifically blocked IP addresses from the NS1 and NS2 postcodes.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: NS1 and NS2 - that's North Swanage. They targeted our area specifically?\n\nTOM CHEN: Exactly. And here's the kicker - Granicus, EHQ's parent company, has a contract with DCC worth £2.3 million. That's Dorset County Council for the record.\n\nSANDRA WILLIAMS: [Phone] I can confirm that. And there's more - Tony Powell's DCF received a grant of £85,000 from DCC just two weeks before the consultation launched.\n\nMARGARET THORNE: This is bigger than we thought. We need to get Margaret Haywood involved - she's the new transparency officer at DCC.\n\nMICHAEL HARRINGTON: I'll run a series on this. Front page Sunday edition. Barry, can NSTCG provide a full timeline?\n\nBARRY CADE: James will coordinate with you, Michael. Now, about Hollister - he's already spreading rumors that Phil isn't eligible to serve because of some technicality.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Let him try. My paperwork is bulletproof. More importantly, I've scheduled meetings with the Swanage Chamber of Commerce and the Purbeck Tourism Board next week.\n\nALICE CHEN: The Chamber president, Richard Blackstone, is sympathetic. His hotel, the Purbeck Arms, would lose 30% of guests if Shore Rd closes.\n\nDR. HART: I should mention - Dr. Patricia Kumar at the surgery (no relation to the Detective Inspector) has been collecting patient impact statements. Over 200 so far.\n\nDI RACHEL KUMAR: If I may return to the harassment claims - Mr. Morrison, when can you provide the counter-evidence?\n\nJAMES MORRISON: This afternoon. We also have witness statements from Colin Fletcher and Marcus Thompson who saw Harrison's behavior.\n\nUNKNOWN SPEAKER 1 [Revealed as DI Kumar]: Thank you. For the record, making false police reports is a serious offense.\n\nTOM CHEN: Barry, I've created a database of all the evidence. It's hosted on secure servers at Dorset Digital. Full encryption, daily backups.\n\nSANDRA WILLIAMS: [Phone] The County CEO, Charles Pemberton, wants to meet with NSTCG leadership. He's worried about the Statistics Authority investigation.\n\nBARRY CADE: Tell Pemberton we're happy to meet, but only with legal representation present. Margaret, can STC provide a lawyer?\n\nMARGARET THORNE: I'll speak to our legal counsel, Jonathan Whitmore at Whitmore & Associates.\n\nMICHAEL HARRINGTON: One more thing - I've heard rumors that EngagementHQ is pulling out of their Dorset contract. My source at Granicus says it's damage control.\n\nALICE CHEN: If they pull out, doesn't that affect all council consultations?\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: It would. Every consultation for the next two years was supposed to use their platform.\n\nDR. HART: Speaking of consultations, the NHS is planning one about the new medical center. If EHQ pulls out, that's delayed too.\n\nTOM CHEN: Actually, my company, Dorset Digital, could provide alternative consultation platforms. Open source, fully transparent.\n\nBARRY CADE: Interesting. Tom, can you prepare a proposal?\n\nUNKNOWN SPEAKER 2 [Revealed as Tom Chen]: Already working on it.\n\nSANDRA WILLIAMS: [Phone] I have to go - Pemberton's calling an emergency meeting. Keep me posted.\n\n[Phone disconnects]\n\nDI RACHEL KUMAR: I have what I need. Mr. Morrison, I'll expect that evidence today. Good day everyone.\n\n[DI Kumar leaves]\n\nMARGARET THORNE: With the detective gone, let's be frank. Hollister and Powell won't give up. They have too much invested.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Agreed. But now we have momentum, media support, and I'm inside the council. The game has changed.\n\nALICE CHEN: The Business Assoc is planning a rally next Saturday. High Street, 2 PM. Can we count on NSTCG support?\n\nBARRY CADE: Absolutely. James, coordinate with Alice on logistics.\n\nMICHAEL HARRINGTON: I'll cover the rally. Phil, can I interview you beforehand?\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Of course. How about Friday at 4?\n\nDR. HART: Before we adjourn, I should mention - the Royal College of Emergency Medicine is interested in our case. Shore Road closures affecting emergency access is a national issue.\n\nTOM CHEN: That's huge. National attention could force DCC to back down.\n\nBARRY CADE: Excellent. Let's wrap up with clear actions. James - evidence to DI Kumar today. Tom - consultation platform proposal. Alice - rally planning. Phil - Chamber and Tourism Board meetings. Dr. Hart - liaise with Royal College. Margaret - STC legal counsel. Michael - Sunday expose. Everyone clear?\n\nALL: Clear.\n\nBARRY CADE: One last thing. We've won a battle, not the war. Stay vigilant, document everything, and watch each other's backs. Meeting adjourned.\n\n[Various goodbye exchanges as people leave]\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: [Privately to Barry] Hollister approached me after the election results. Offered to 'guide' me on the council. I told him I had all the guidance I needed.\n\nBARRY CADE: Good. He's trying to control you already. Stay strong, Phil. We're just getting started.",
