  "content": "BARRY CADE: Alright everyone, thanks for joining tonight's strategy call. We need to discuss our response to yesterday's council meeting. I heard David Hollister made some interesting comments.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Interesting is one way to put it, Barry. He directly violated Purdah restrictions by mentioning me by name and disparaging our campaign. Margaret Thorne stood up to him though.\n\nALICE CHEN: I'm Alice Chen, I'm new to the group - I run Chen's Hardware on Station Road. The Shore Road closure would devastate our deliveries. I want to help however I can.\n\nBARRY CADE: Welcome Alice! We need all the local business support we can get. James, can you update us on the statistics complaint?\n\nJAMES MORRISON: I've drafted the formal complaint to the UK Statistics Authority. The key points are the mid-survey CAPTCHA implementation on June 26th and the lack of paper alternatives for elderly residents. I'll need your review, Barry, before we submit.\n\nBARRY CADE: Send it to me tonight, I'll review first thing tomorrow. Now, let's talk about the pressure campaign. We need to organize an email campaign targeting Cliff Sutton - he's the weak link in the council.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Agreed. Also, I've been thinking - we should reach out to the Purbeck Gazette. Their editor, Michael Harrington, might be sympathetic to our cause. He's no friend of Swanage News.\n\nALICE CHEN: I can organize the Station Road Business Association. We represent 15 shops and restaurants that would be affected.\n\nJAMES MORRISON: That's brilliant, Alice. Barry, should we create a dedicated task force for business outreach?\n\nBARRY CADE: Absolutely. Alice, I'm putting you in charge of business community outreach. Can you have a list of affected businesses and their concerns by Friday?\n\nALICE CHEN: Consider it done.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: We also need to address the Dorset Highways consultation. They're working hand-in-hand with DCF on this.\n\nBARRY CADE: Good point. James, add Dorset Highways to your complaint. They're complicit in this sham consultation.\n\nJAMES MORRISON: Will do. Also, I've discovered something interesting - Engagement HQ is actually a subsidiary of Granicus, a much larger company. This goes deeper than we thought.\n\nBARRY CADE: Document everything. We might need to escalate this beyond local authorities. \n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Speaking of escalation, I've been invited to speak at the Dorset Democracy Forum next week. It's a regional group that monitors local government transparency.\n\nBARRY CADE: Excellent platform. Make sure to mention the Purdah violation and the survey manipulation.\n\nALICE CHEN: Should we be documenting all these transgressions somewhere central? We're gathering a lot of evidence.\n\nJAMES MORRISON: I've been keeping a spreadsheet, but we might need something more robust. Maybe a shared database?\n\nBARRY CADE: James, look into setting up a proper evidence management system. We need everything documented and cross-referenced.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: Before we wrap up, what about the door-to-door canvassing? The election is next week.\n\nBARRY CADE: I need volunteers for the final push. We're focusing on North Swanage, particularly the streets around Newton Road and Redcliffe Road. Can everyone commit to at least two hours this weekend?\n\nALL: Yes, confirmed.\n\nJAMES MORRISON: One more thing - I've heard rumors that Dorset Council might be reviewing their relationship with DCF after our complaints. My contact at County Hall, Sandra Williams, mentioned it off the record.\n\nBARRY CADE: Interesting. James, can you follow up with Sandra? But carefully - we don't want to compromise her position.\n\nPHILIPPE EDES: This is all very encouraging. We're building real momentum.\n\nBARRY CADE: Indeed. Let's recap assignments: James - finalize the Statistics Authority complaint and research evidence management systems. Alice - organize the business association and get that impact list. Phillippe - prepare for the Democracy Forum. I'll handle the Cliff Sutton email campaign and coordinate canvassing. Any questions?\n\nALICE CHEN: Just one - should we be worried about retaliation? David Hollister seems quite vindictive.\n\nBARRY CADE: Document everything, stay factual, and always operate in groups when canvassing. We're on the right side of this.\n\nJAMES MORRISON: Agreed. Truth is our best defense.\n\nBARRY CADE: Alright team, let's reconvene Friday evening. Stay strong, stay focused. We're going to win this.\n\n[Call ends]",
