Present:
- Mayor John Smith (Swanage Town Council)
- Sarah Johnson (Council Planning Department)
- Mark Wilson (Community Representative)

Discussion Points:

1. Beach Hut Survey Concerns
The Mayor expressed concerns about the methodology used in the recent beach hut survey. 
He stated that the survey failed to capture input from long-term residents and focused 
primarily on tourist opinions.

Sarah Johnson from Planning noted that the survey was conducted according to standard 
procedures but acknowledged that the timing (during peak tourist season) may have 
skewed results.

2. Action Items
- Mark Wilson to organize a community meeting for resident feedback (Due: January 20)
- Planning Department to review survey methodology (Due: February 1)
- Mayor to draft letter to county council highlighting concerns

3. Identified Issues
The Mayor's dismissal of resident concerns in favor of tourist revenue appears to be 
a pattern. This represents a potential breach of his duty to represent constituents.
