# Deduplication System Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **API Key Error**: The system now handles invalid or missing API keys gracefully
2. **LLM Initialization**: Only initializes AI components when needed
3. **Database Loading**: Fixed path issues - now loads all 14 databases correctly
4. **Primary Entity Selection**: Users can now choose which entity to keep as primary during merge
5. **Merge Execution**: Review decisions are now actually applied (merges are executed)
6. **List Value Handling**: Fixed error when merging entities with list/array fields (e.g., multiple emails)
7. **Config Key Errors**: Fixed KeyError for 'enable_safety_checks' and other config values
8. **Smart List Comparison**: Safety checks now properly handle overlapping values in lists
9. **Low Confidence Review**: Fixed bug where low confidence matches weren't included in review despite being shown in summary

## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: Direct Script (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# This bypasses the CLI and shows results immediately
python scripts/test_people_deduplication.py
```

### Option 2: Safe CLI Launcher
```bash
# This checks your environment first
python scripts/run_dedupe_cli_safe.py
```

### Option 3: Standard CLI
```bash
python scripts/dedupe_cli.py
```

When using the CLI:
1. Choose **[1] New Analysis** from the main menu
2. Select **People & Contacts** (usually option 4) or press Enter for all
3. At AI Settings, choose **No** to disable AI if you don't have valid API keys
4. Review the matches interactively:
   - Press **'a'** to approve a merge
   - Press **'s'** to swap which entity is primary (kept as base)
   - Press **'m'** to preview what the merge will look like
   - Press **'r'** to reject (not duplicates)
5. After review, you'll be asked if you want to apply the approved merges

## üìä Found Duplicates in People Database

The system correctly identified:

**High Confidence (>90%)**
- Tony Powell (2 entries with org variations)
- Elaine Snow (exact duplicate)
- Colin/Collin Bright (same email, typo in name)

**Medium Confidence (70-90%)**
- David Hollister (appears twice)
- Gary Suttle (appears twice)

## üîß Configuration

The system uses these model IDs:
- Primary: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- Alternatives: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `claude-opus-4-20250514`

But works perfectly fine without AI using fuzzy matching algorithms.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Mode

- **Always ON by default**
- No automatic changes without confirmation
- All matches require manual review
- Full audit trail of decisions
- Merges are only applied after explicit user confirmation

## üîÑ Merge Behavior

When merging duplicates:
- The **PRIMARY** entity is kept as the base record
- Empty fields are filled from the secondary entity
- Conflicting data is preserved in metadata (_merge_info)
- Use **'s'** key during review to swap which entity is primary
- Use **'m'** key to preview the merge result before approving

### Conservative Merge Strategy (Default)
- Preserves primary entity's data when conflicts exist
- Only fills empty fields from secondary entity
- Records all conflicts in _merge_info metadata
- Safe approach that prevents data loss

### List/Array Fields
- The system properly handles fields with multiple values (e.g., multiple emails)
- Safety checks recognize overlapping values (e.g., same email in both entities)
- Lists are preserved in the merged entity
