## Next Steps (Optional)

While all requested tasks have been completed, potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Increase Coverage** - Target 95% coverage
2. **Load Testing** - Test with 100+ concurrent transcripts
3. **Stress Testing** - Test system limits and recovery
4. **Security Testing** - Validate input sanitization
5. **Mutation Testing** - Verify test effectiveness

## Conclusion

The comprehensive testing implementation is now complete as requested. The Blackcore minimal module has robust test coverage across unit, integration, and performance dimensions. All tests are passing, CI/CD is configured, and the system is validated to work within Notion API limits.

The test suite provides confidence that the module will reliably process transcripts and sync with Notion while handling errors gracefully and maintaining good performance.
