Of course. Here is a README for the `Blackcore` repository, written to be both descriptive and evocative of the # Blackcore

> The Intelligence Processing & Automation Engine for Project Nassau.

## 1. Overview

Blackcore is a Python-based intelligence processing system that interfaces with Notion workspaces to create structured knowledge graphs from raw intelligence data. It provides a secure, scalable foundation for transforming unstructured information into actionable insights.

The system emphasizes security-first design, robust error handling, and enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to evolving intelligence requirements.

## 2. Core Philosophy

This project operates on the principle that victory is achieved not through brute force alone, but through superior intelligence and flawless execution. While Notion serves as our central map room and database, Blackcore provides the instruments to work that data.

This codebase is built to:
*   **Systemize Intelligence:** Convert raw, unstructured data (voice transcripts, meeting notes) into structured, relational objects.
*   **Automate Analysis:** Leverage AI APIs to perform deep analysis on documents and data that would be too time-consuming for a human crew.
*   **Create Connections:** Programmatically build and maintain the relationships between people, organizations, places, events, and transgressions, revealing patterns and opportunities that might otherwise be missed.
*   **Maintain Operational Rhythm:** Provide the tools to ensure our strategic actions are perfectly synchronized with our intelligence-gathering efforts.

## 3. Key Components (Implemented)

### Security Layer
*   **Secrets Manager:** Encrypted storage and rotation of API keys with audit logging
*   **URL Validator:** SSRF prevention with private IP blocking and domain whitelisting
*   **Input Sanitizer:** Protection against injection attacks with HTML escaping
*   **Audit Logger:** Comprehensive security event tracking with sensitive data redaction

### Error Handling Framework
*   **Contextual Error System:** Rich error context preservation for debugging
*   **Retry Logic:** Intelligent retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
*   **Rate Limit Handling:** Automatic detection and handling of API rate limits
*   **User-Friendly Messages:** Clear error messages for common issues

### Property Handlers
*   **Type-Safe Handler Registry:** Automatic registration and validation of property types
*   **Comprehensive Type Support:** Title, Rich Text, Number, Select, Multi-Select, Date, People, Files, Checkbox, URL, Email, Phone, Relation, Formula, Rollup, and timestamp handlers
*   **Bidirectional Conversion:** Seamless conversion between Notion API format and Python objects

### Repository Pattern
*   **Page Repository:** CRUD operations for Notion pages with batch support
*   **Database Repository:** Schema management and query operations
*   **Search Repository:** Unified search across workspaces with filtering

### Notion Integration
*   **Client Wrapper:** Rate-limited API client with automatic retries
*   **Response Validation:** Pydantic models for type-safe API responses
*   **Pagination Support:** Automatic handling of large result sets

## 4. The Intelligence Workflow

The workflow enabled by Blackcore is designed to be a continuous, cyclical process:

1.  **Capture:** The Strategist records raw intelligence on the go.
2.  **Structure:** The Technician, aided by Blackcore scripts, parses this intelligence, creating and linking the relevant objects within our Notion databases.
3.  **Analyze:** Blackcore sends the structured data to our AI models for deep analysis, research, and prompt-driven content creation.
4.  **Enrich:** The AI's output is then programmatically written back into Notion, enriching our knowledge graph with new insights, summaries, and actionable tasks.

This loop ensures we are constantly refining our intelligence and adapting our strategy based on the most current information available.

## 5. Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- uv (recommended) or pip

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackcore.git
cd blackcore

# Install dependencies
uv sync  # or: pip install -e .

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys:
# - NOTION_API_KEY
# - NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (optional)
# - GOOGLE_API_KEY (optional)

# Run tests to verify installation
pytest
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# Initialize Notion databases
python scripts/setup_databases.py

# Verify configuration
python scripts/verify_databases.py
```

## 6. Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=blackcore

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_security.py -v
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Lint code
ruff check .

# Format code
ruff format .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix .
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Security First:** All external inputs validated, secrets encrypted
- **Test-Driven Development:** Comprehensive test coverage (>94%)
- **Type Safety:** Full type hints with Pydantic validation
- **Error Resilience:** Graceful handling of API failures
- **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of security-relevant events

## 7. Current Status

### Phase 0 Complete âœ“
- Core security infrastructure implemented
- Error handling framework operational
- Property handlers for all Notion types
- Repository pattern with full CRUD support
- 112/112 tests passing

### Next Steps (Phase 1)
- Implement ingestion engine for Google Drive
- Add AI integration layer (Claude/Gemini)
- Build relational linking system
- Create automated reporting modules

## 8. Security Considerations

Blackcore implements defense-in-depth security:
- Encrypted secrets storage with key rotation
- SSRF protection blocking private networks
- Input sanitization preventing injection attacks
- Comprehensive audit logging with PII redaction
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
