SQLite/DuckDB → NetworkX → Memgraph → Neo4j → TigerGraph
```

## Option 1: Enhanced Relational Database Approach

### SQLite with FTS5 Full-Text Search

**What it is**: Enhance your existing database with powerful full-text search and basic relationship queries.

**Corruption Investigation Benefits:**
- **NEAR queries**: Find when "Councillor Smith" appears within 5 words of "ABC Construction"
- **Phrase searches**: Identify exact quotes or specific meeting discussions
- **Boolean operators**: Complex searches like "(Smith OR Jones) AND (planning application)"
- **Relevance scoring**: Automatically rank results by importance

**Example Investigation Queries:**
```sql
-- Find all transcripts where councillors and contractors are mentioned together
SELECT * FROM transcripts 
WHERE content MATCH 'councillor NEAR/10 contractor';

-- Search for voting patterns
SELECT * FROM transcripts 
WHERE content MATCH '(vote OR voting) AND (planning OR development)';

-- Find conflicts of interest mentions
SELECT * FROM transcripts 
WHERE content MATCH 'conflict NEAR/5 interest';
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Already familiar technology (SQLite)
- ✅ No additional server setup required
- ✅ Excellent performance for text searches
- ✅ Minimal learning curve
- ✅ Works with existing Blackcore infrastructure

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Limited multi-hop relationship queries
- ❌ No visual network diagrams
- ❌ Manual pattern detection required
- ❌ Basic relationship modeling only

### DuckDB for Analytics

**What it is**: Fast analytical database excellent at complex queries over your existing data.

**Corruption Investigation Benefits:**
- **Window functions**: Track changes in voting patterns over time
- **Complex aggregations**: Identify unusual patterns in contract awards
- **JSON support**: Analyze your existing Notion data directly
- **Python integration**: Seamless with your current stack

**Example Investigation Queries:**
```sql
-- Find councillors who vote together frequently
SELECT 
    c1.name, c2.name, 
    COUNT(*) as co_votes,
    AVG(CASE WHEN c1.vote = c2.vote THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as alignment_rate
FROM votes c1
JOIN votes c2 ON c1.meeting_id = c2.meeting_id 
WHERE c1.councillor_id != c2.councillor_id
GROUP BY c1.name, c2.name
HAVING alignment_rate > 0.8;

-- Detect unusual contract patterns
SELECT contractor, COUNT(*) as wins, AVG(value) as avg_value
FROM contracts 
GROUP BY contractor
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(contract_count) * 2 FROM 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) as contract_count FROM contracts GROUP BY contractor));
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Extremely fast analytical queries
- ✅ Works directly with your JSON files
- ✅ No server management required
- ✅ Excellent Python integration
- ✅ Handles large datasets efficiently

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Not a true graph database
- ❌ Complex relationship queries require SQL expertise
- ❌ No built-in visualization
- ❌ Manual network analysis

## Option 2: Python-Based Graph Analysis

### NetworkX + DuckDB Hybrid

**What it is**: Use DuckDB for data storage/queries, NetworkX for graph analysis.

**Corruption Investigation Benefits:**
- **Community detection**: Automatically identify corruption clusters
- **Centrality analysis**: Find the most influential people in networks
- **Path analysis**: Trace connections between entities
- **Visualization**: Create network diagrams for presentations

**Example Investigation Code:**
```python
import networkx as nx
import duckdb

# Load data from DuckDB
conn = duckdb.connect('corruption.db')
edges = conn.execute("""
    SELECT person1, person2, relationship_type, strength
    FROM relationships
""").fetchall()

# Create graph
G = nx.Graph()
for person1, person2, rel_type, strength in edges:
    G.add_edge(person1, person2, type=rel_type, weight=strength)

# Find communities (corruption clusters)
communities = nx.community.louvain_communities(G)

# Find most influential people
centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
key_players = sorted(centrality.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]

# Find shortest corruption path
path = nx.shortest_path(G, "Councillor Smith", "ABC Construction")
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Powerful graph algorithms
- ✅ Great visualization capabilities
- ✅ Flexible and customizable
- ✅ Works with your existing data
- ✅ Extensive Python ecosystem

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Requires programming knowledge
- ❌ Manual data pipeline creation
- ❌ No real-time updates
- ❌ Performance issues with very large graphs

## Option 3: Lightweight Graph Databases

### Memgraph (Neo4j-Compatible Alternative)

**What it is**: Fast, lightweight graph database that uses the same Cypher query language as Neo4j.

**Key Advantages:**
- **50x faster** than Neo4j for write operations
- **8x faster** for read operations
- **Drop-in replacement** - same Cypher queries work
- **In-memory processing** for real-time analysis
- **Open source** with no licensing costs

**Migration Path:**
```cypher
-- Same queries as Neo4j, but faster execution
MATCH (c:Councillor)-[:VOTES_WITH]->(other:Councillor)
WHERE c.name = "Smith"
RETURN other.name, COUNT(*) as collaboration_count
ORDER BY collaboration_count DESC;
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ All Neo4j benefits with better performance
- ✅ No query language relearning required
- ✅ Significantly lower costs
- ✅ Better suited for real-time analysis
- ✅ Simpler deployment

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Still requires graph database knowledge
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem than Neo4j
- ❌ Less enterprise tooling

### OrientDB (Multi-Model Database)

**What it is**: Combines graph, document, and key-value storage in one database.

**Unique Benefits:**
- **10x faster** than Neo4j according to IBM benchmarks
- **Multi-model**: Store transcripts as documents, relationships as graphs
- **SQL support**: Use familiar SQL alongside graph queries
- **JSON storage**: Direct integration with your existing JSON data

**Example Hybrid Query:**
```sql
-- SQL for basic queries, graph traversal for relationships
SELECT name FROM Person 
WHERE name IN (
    TRAVERSE out('WORKS_FOR') FROM (
        SELECT FROM Organization WHERE name = 'ABC Construction'
    )
);
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Faster than Neo4j
- ✅ Familiar SQL interface
- ✅ Handles both documents and graphs
- ✅ Direct JSON support
- ✅ Cost-effective

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Learning curve for graph concepts
- ❌ Smaller community
- ❌ Less documentation than Neo4j
