# Data Remediation Summary Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented the data remediation plan from `specs/data-remediation-plan.md`. All JSON files have been cleaned, deduplicated, standardized, and validated for relational integrity.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. People & Contacts (`people_places.json`)
- Added 16 new people extracted from intelligence transcripts and other relational fields
- Total people in database: 43
- Maintained existing structure with Full Name, Role, Status, Organization, and Notes fields

### 2. Key Places & Events (`places_events.json`)
- Removed 5 misplaced organization entries
- Moved organizations to `organizations_bodies.json`
- Cleaned data now contains only actual places and events

### 3. Organizations & Bodies (`organizations_bodies.json`)
- Fixed JSON structure from list to proper dictionary format
- Removed 5 duplicate entries
- Added 2 missing organizations (Dorset Coast Forum, Granicus)
- Merged data from `places_events.json`
- Total organizations: 13

### 4. Identified Transgressions (`identified_transgressions.json`)
- Flattened nested list structure
- Removed duplicate entries
- Merged entries with same name, preserving most complete data
- Final count: 1 consolidated transgression entry

### 5. Documents & Evidence (`documents_evidence.json`)
- Standardized complex Notion API structure to simple key-value format
- Fixed root key from "Documents and Evidence" to "Documents & Evidence"
- Total documents: 6

### 6. Agendas & Epics (`agendas_epics.json`)
- Fixed root key from "Agendas and Epics" to "Agendas & Epics"
- Merged duplicate phase entries into consolidated agendas
- Updated agenda titles for consistency
- Total agendas: 8

### 7. Actionable Tasks (`actionable_tasks.json`)
- Updated relational links to match new agenda names
- Fixed references to merged agendas
- All task relationships now valid

### 8. New Database: Concepts (`concepts.json`)
- Created new database for abstract entities
- Added 4 concepts: Survey Manipulation, Gemini AI, Data Analysis, Scrutiny Committee
- Resolves tagging issues for non-person/non-organization entities

## Validation Results
- Initial validation found 10 relational integrity issues
- After fixes: **0 issues** - all relations validated successfully
- All cross-database references now properly linked
- Complete relational integrity achieved

## Backup Strategy
- Created timestamped backups before each remediation run
- Backups stored in `/backups/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- Multiple backup points ensure data recovery if needed

## Scripts Created
1. `scripts/data_remediation.py` - Main remediation script
2. `scripts/fix_remaining_issues.py` - Secondary fixes for edge cases
3. `validation_report.json` - Detailed validation results

## Next Steps
The data is now clean and ready for:
1. Notion synchronization using the JSON sync functionality
2. Further data entry and relationship building
3. AI-powered entity extraction and analysis

All relational integrity is maintained, ensuring smooth operation of the Blackcore system.
